With the development of science,electronic products become increaseingly popular.And there are kinds of products to let us choose.For example,mobile phone, MP4,etc. 
These products make a big influence to our daily life.First,we can communicate with whoever we wantand whenever we like,but itis unbelieve ten years ago.Moreover,we have computer to surf the internet and get information freely,but in the past,we had to buy a newspaper to learn some news happened one day before.Also,nowadays,I believe there is no one wanting to send a mile to connect with friends,because we can send e-mail. 
I think we can't rely on the electronic products too much,we should find some thing close to nature.That is the true life.

With the widely use of electronic products such as computers and mobile phones, our life becomes easier and happier. And electronic products exit almost in every aspect of our daily life, for example, electronic dictionaries are very helpful in our study, and digital cameras make taking photos so easy that even kids can do it. As for mobile phones, we all feel nervous without it in our pocket, because we are worried about missing important calls.
As you can see, electronic products are fairly important in life, but I think we shouldn't be surrounded by them all the time, it'll make us tired and anxiety, so it is a good idea for us to find a time that we are free, then close your phone and leave your MP3 at home, just go out and enjoy the beautiful nature.

Nowadays,there are more and more electronics,they take an important part in our lives.Even some people can't live without electronics.
In the past,many things need people to do,but now electronics help us most housework and officework.we needn't cook rice by ourself and also needn't clean thr=e house because the robot would clean.And computer takes the most important part in our lives.We can do everything through the internet,such as study,shopping,seeing movies as so on.
Electronics make our lives more comfortable,but it also take us some harm.They cost too much energy,but the world is seriesly lack of energy.And we lose the chance of exercise too.Electronics have both of beneficial and harm,but I think it has more beneficials.

Nowadays,the variety of digital products is rapidly increasing.Many people have not just one digital matter.
It's undenible that almost every field of human life digital produsts have remarked impact on.For example,the widely used of mobile phone not only changes the means of communication ,but also speeds up the development of whole society. We can say every influential digital matter is the icon of human progress.
But every coin has two sides.The digital things that are misused or abused are truly mental drug.Some teenagers are addicted to computer games or social networks without working and studying.This phenomenon in a extrme way calls us to think what attitude we should hold when using digital produsts.
With the assistance of digital produsts,now our life is more colorful and easier than ever before.In my opinion,digital matter is a powerful tool for us to deal with our prblems if we use it in a proper way,otherwise it's just another problem for us.So ,we have to clearly understand the relationship of human and digital produsts in order that we can use it more effecive.

With the development of advanced science, more and more electronic products are invented . they play an important role more or less in modern life, such as computer, phone and so on.
I have to say, no computer, no modern society. The reason for my idea is that it is the computer that connecting our world together. It can solve many problems in science, daily life. For an example, we can use computer buy goods if we do not want shopping. Another one is phone, phone makes us communicate with each other anywhere. There is no denying that both of them do have great advantages.
But there, I want to say, they also have bad influences. As for computer, if you addicted to computer games, it will destroy a person. So the important thing is make the balance between the advantage and disadvantage and how to use these tools to make our life better.

Nowadays, digital productions can be seen everywhere. Almost every person has least one digital thing,even my 73-year-old grandpa.Cellphone,computer,digital camera,MP3 player...All of our lives are changed by them.
Cellphone makes it easy for us to connect with others,and know the current affairs immediately no matter where you are. Computer changes people's way of working,studying,entertainment even shopping,like my mother, who was crazy in shopping in mall,now is addicted to shopping online.Digital camera is different from traditional camera.Compared to traditional one, it is much cheaper,easier to use.People like to record every thing with it. MP3 player also replace the position of Walkman and become a most popular thing among the youngs.It's so obvious that digital products affect our lives in all aspects.
I hold the view that digital things are benefit our lives.They make our lives funny,make our work,study in a high speed.Various thing come to our life.So,they are necessary,and will be better and better,plays a more important role in future.I like them very much.

In our age, electronic products are more and more,such ascomputer, cellphone, MP4, PDA and so on.What's more,they play an important role in our daliy life. We communicate with our friends and relations often using cellphone or computer,so the electronic products are necessaries for us.
In the world,for example,the bank must have the computers. Because they have to use the Internet to do many things. If I go to the bank to save money, the staff must use the computer to write the information of mine.
So I think the elecetronic products sre more and more inportant for us. Without them ,we nearly can't do anything,even a very simple thing :saving money. So we should make good use of them to improve our life level.

Now with the development of technology and science,the rapidly increasing number of digital product hasled to a stronger  impact  on  our  life .And whether theybring us benefits or not has made into controversy. 
It is obvious that digital product make our life more and more convenient and comfortable .For example,now we are able to book train tickets online or through your mobilephon. we can also purchase a viety of things such as cloth,books on  Internet.Of  course  we will get information so easily that  we don't have to go to bookstore or librarywhen we need some useful information.In a word,digital product like mobilephone, computer  are be lots of benefitsto our daily life and study.
But some people wonder that digital product also bring us something bad.More and more teenagers are addicted in the computer game so that their study are being ingnoranted and becoming  terrible.And  a increasing number of person become addiction in mobilephone.
In my opinion,we should use digital product in proper way to make our life more delight and convenient.If we can can control our spirit in case that we will be addicted in them,digital product is so good.

Electronic products are useful in our life. We can use them communicate with who are far from me. And electronic products make work easier than the past.
I like electronic products. I can study online, and play computer games online. I also can talk with my parents by mobile phone.So I think electronic products will be much more important.

Nowadays, the number of digital production becomes larger and larger. According to a recent survey, in developed countries, almost everyone has a digital production. Even in developing countries, the number of it increases every minutes.
It's undeniable that digital production makes of great difference in each of field in our life. Due to it, traditional books can be taken place of E-book, making students learn knowledge easily and freely. What's more, workers can finish their work in their house. However, the developing in entertament pose a threat to our real live.
In my view, it's of great urgency to creat new production to realize our need. And there is no doubt that we should strenglen the learning of how to force ourselves back into the real world. Only in this way can we enjoy our live better.

With the unbelieveable development of science and technology, new digital machines are invented every day. And we really have been to "The Digital Age".
As we know, the digital machines make great effects on our life. For example, the cellphone, we used to communicate with others only before, but we can watch movies, play games, read news on the Internet on cellphone now. On the contrary, the digital machines also lead to some bad effects while they improve our life. Some students play games on the computer so that they seldom attend the formal lessons, what's worse, some of them even will been punished by school. Besides, the digital machines do a serve damage to environment especially they are too old to use and are threw out everywhere by people.
In my opinion, if we can use the digital machines properly, we will relax ourselves by them at our spare time. And as long as we collect the old machines together, we will lead less damage to environment.

The digital machines play important roles in our life. They lead to a great influence in several aspects of our lives. First, with the digital machines, people will be able to spend less time. For example, the e-bank is convernient for people to raise money or buy what they need. Second, they can play a better guard in the supermarket, the parking lot, the house and more. They increase the security. Third, people may enjoy the life with the digital machines. They can listen music anywhere with a music player and take photos by using a digital camera. It's really fine.
Personally, the digital machines is good to our lives. With the digital machines, we can do a lot of things that we cannot do without them. I can't image what the life is without the digital machines. It is a digital age.

At present, electronic product is playing more and more important role in our daily life. It is common to see that nearly all the teenagers are with a mobile or a MP4. even some little guys included. So we can say that we are setting our feet in the Digital Age.
Even though these products are of great use in many aspects of our life. There is also a debate raging over whether such kind of products should be used so worldwide, and whether they should take up so much room of people's daily life. certainly, these products can make people, especially students to relax themselves after their work. It also can extend people's horizon by searching useful information through it. 
However, more and more disadvantage are displaying their appearance. For example, many students sank themselves into the virtual world and can't control themselves. This kind of case has a bad effect on their studies. Even their parents have no idea how to stop them.
In my opinion, every thing has two sides. If we use it properly, it's benefits will outwheigh it's disadvantages. when we use it, we should set proper time apart on it.

Recently, with the development of the science, the digital age is coming to our life. A variety of digital productions become more and more. Not only these , they have become smaller and smaller.
With the help of digital productions , our daily life has change a lot compared with the life of our parents. We can use the cell phone surf the internet or use the E-book to learn the English even use a watch as a cell phone. The life is becoming more convenient. It has a lot of effect on our life.
In my view, the digital productions have a lot of benefits. For example, it has benefits on environment. We would not cut down the trees to make paper. But the digital product still can not take place of some traditional thing. The book can be collected, but the E-book can not be.

Now, humans have stepped into the digital age with large numbers of electronic production flooding into our daily life.
Almost every aspect of our life has been influenced to a large degree by these productions. Above all, the communication method has changed a lot, from previous mobilephone to current e-mail,QQ,renren and so on. Meanwhile, e-book is always popular among teenagers. For its advantages such as cheap , portable to carry, it has showed more advantages over traditional ones.As we all know ,we must wait in a long line to deposit and withdraw in banks in previous age, while now ATM can help do these within several minutes.
In my opinion, I prefer electronic productions for their less maximum,portable and convenient to our daily life.

In this time, as more and more electronic products, such as e-book, MP4, moile phone, pad and so on, are popularized, this influence of them is more and more obvious.
These electric products have a huge influence in many aspect of our life, especially. In china, this number of mobile phone nearly equal to the population. Thanks to mobile phone and other communication which is convince by other products, our communication get vivid. Now we can keep in touch with others by not only short massage, calling, but also other fashionably way for instance twitters, micro blog, QQ, msn and so on. The influence about entertainment is huger than communication. Now if you have one of those, MP4, PSP, mobile phone, NDS, or pad, you can enjoy music, movie, games and other thing in mostly wherever you want to!
In my opinion, every coin has two sides, in other words, the popularize of electronic has negative aspect as well as its benefaction. First of all, more electronic products mean more electronic junks. It's not friendly to environment.  Now what's more, some students or teens are addicted to the entertainment of these electronic products. Finally, the convince communication make some people stay at home day by day. So, I think, we should have a true attitude and method to electronic products.

With the coming of the digital age, an increasing number of electronic products play an important role in our daily life.
It is obvious that the electronic products benefit us in many aspects. On one hand, the electronic products make it convenient for us to acquire a great deal of information and knowledge, which, to some extent, will do good to our study. On the other hand, some electronic products are designed in particular to relax and entertain ourselves after hard work. However, in spite of the electronic products have many advantages, they are not trouble-free. With the flood of information we find it difficult to make informed choices. Furthermore, the electronic products sometimes deprive us of time to do other physical activities.
In my opinion, it is hard to say whether the electronic products are good or bad. Because it is how we use them that matters, if we make full use of them, the future of the electronic products is promosing.

Now,  more and more students have mp4, cellphone or notebook computer. These digital productions make large effections to our life.Some students use them to study something. But there are also many students sink in them.
Computer or iphone is just an object. If we use it right, they can help us much. They can help us check the informations, upload questions for help. Teachers can also answer us thought them. If we fell tired, we can relax ourselves by useing mp4 to watch cartoon, listen music. Play computer games for a  short time is also a good choise. If we feel lonely, we can make a call to our family. They are so important to our life so we can't leave them.
But, if we can't self-control good, we will sink in them easily. Some students stay in netbar day and night. They give up their study, just stay there to play online game. So, they were sent back their home.
So, we should use digital productions effective. Make them servise for us, not be controled by them.

Some electric productions also influenced parents . The phone has a greatest development. We can see, a great number of students have a phone even two or more. We can use telephone to comunicate with friends in other place and parents. After study we can use telephone playing game and so on. And we can use e-book reading book and studing.
As far as I am concerned the electric productions is important, but we should use it truely, the electric productions may be a bad influence for our study. Everything has its own advantage and disadvantage.

Telephone, calculator and computer and so on. In today's life, every minute, anywhere and everybody can enjoy the digital age.
When we are at home, we would want to watch TV on which we can enjoy a football game, get some news or just for advertisements. When we are on a chip, we will feel safety with a cellphone. Because we need to keep in touch with our famalies and our friends. When we do some science research, we need a computer, which we use to record some imformation and analize. In a word, digital products play a must role in our life.
And to my view, lies in the fact that digital products have made our life easier, I think we also need to use them directly. For example, we should't use a computer only for games. In our life, we can also find some people being addicted to computer games and die for that.
So, in the digital age, we also need to control oursevles.

However, its negative is obvious, using digital product can cause some diease, and may affect our study, For example, many students addicted to the computer games. On the other hand, it will pollute the environment when product those digital product.
In my opinions, the pros outweight the cons. After all the digital product can enrich our life, and making our study and working more efficiently. So that we can keep pace with the social development. The key lies in ourselves, if we exercise more care over this dilicate matter, we can change it to a useful tool!

At school, students could enjoy the digital teaching tools so that they learn more happily and effiently. At home, the housewife do many houseworks more easily with the help of digital products like washing machine. Worker could do more work and earn more money through digital products especially computer.
What's more, in spare time, people could enjoy watching TV, listening to music to relax themselves. In addition, mobile phone and email could make people communicate with each other whenever they want.
As far as I am concerned, digital products actually bring great benefit to people. They should be used more and applied to more areas to build a greater world.

With the development of science technology,more and more electronic products appear in the modern society.With their more and more diversities and stronger and stronger fundation(functions),they play an important role in our life step  by step.Our hands become useless but free.We don't have to wash clothes by hands or use wood to cook.Lights lead us spend every happy night.We watch TV programs or play computer games in our spare time.Using a small walkman in our pockets,we can hear all songs we want to listen to while walking,running or even in a scilent(silent) meeting.In another more important aspect,the digital products work efficiently and quickly in factories.They do anything we ordered and they never feel tired.They don't need salary but enough electric.They do  best work that no one can achieve.
I really like digital products but they still have some problems.Their convenience make us lazier and less healthy because of not having enough sports exercise.They use more energy than humans to achieve the same work.In the modern world where there is energy risk,we should do something by ourselves.

With the development of scinece and technology, nowadays, a growing number of electronic products is being nade, and more and more people are combined with the electronic products.
Undoubtedly, electronic prodcts make an difference to our daily life. In the classroom, my teachers are using the computer to teach us lesson, compared with the class before, We obviously obtain much more information. In the restaurant, my classmates sometimes play a cellphone or lisen to the walkman while waiting for their food. But on the other hand, some of my classmates don't deal with the electronic products correctly, for example, the compter games never fails to fanscinate some adolescense, and they are poor in the study as a reslt. As well, the pollution from the electronic products is disturbing us.
I think the public needs to have a basic understanding of electronic product, as the says goes, nothing is to be feared, it is only to be understood, we should make full use of the electronic product in the correct and sinsible way.

Nowadays, more and more digital products have been produced and these products now is changing our life. Some of this are very important to us such as TV, cellphone and computer. Almost everyone need them. Not only can they let us know the news, weather or other things we want to know, but they are able to give us enjoyment. Having a TV, we can see whatever occurred even though it has a long distance from us. Cellphone can bring the sounds of our relation when we miss them. Computer can do almost everything we need. When we have too much spare time, we also can use them to play some games. Too many angles they change our life. Faced this situation some people seem to not be able to get used to them and others show their worries to it because many students spend too much time playing digital things. In my opinion, first we should be happy for the progress of this and try to be used to this. Of cause we can't play them too much since everything has 2sides. I blieve we can use it in a better way.

In the morden time vavieties of digital productions come to our life, say, we usually walk with the mp3 playing music or we use our iphone to suffer the Internet waiting for our teacher before class. We'd have to say "now it is the digital age".
Now enjoying the service of digital productions is one parts of news to mom from the Internet wages instead of handing a traditional newspaper finding important news. A washing machine can call mom to take the clothes washed. They are not only in our routine life but also in our work. Dady rush out from our house with hid liptop what he use to design the building. That all.
Electronic productions have change our life. They do make our life more easy, but I hold the view that we can't forget the happy time the traditional things give us. Make the digital productions to good use is a great idea.

But they also lead to some problems.The signal of mobile phone do harm to our health.Students play games in class.People don't sleep at night in order to surf the internet.I think we can avoid the bad influence only if we use these electrical products in a right way.

Now, there are more and more electric products in our life, such as computer, celephone, clock, and so on. It seems that most things we do now are connected with electric products. 
Nowadays, as electric products being more, they have made great influence in each part of our life. To begin with, we needn't to write letters to our close friends and family any longer since we can make a call to tell them things we want to say, so that we won't wait for a long time. Besides, we can get the information we need from the Internet now. It is more easy for us because we needn't get a book or newspaper to know them. What's more, we can travel to anywhere we want but won't feel lonely. We can see everyone we want at every time since we can use computer to chat with them.
As far as I'm concerned, I think electric products benefit our life. By using them, we can spend less time on things than before. And things that seem difficult to do before are easier for us to do now. In a word, I think electric products are valuable for us in our life.

Yestoday afternoon, I found many electronic products displayied in the supermarkets, such as MP3, MP4, mobile phone and E-book, when I went to downtown with my classmates. Nowadays, there is an increasing kinds of electronic products.
There is no doubt that so many electronic products are making a great difference of our life. But every coin has two sides. In one hand, electronic products makes our life more easy and colorful. We use mobile phones to communite with others when and where we want. We relax ourself by listening music by MP3, MP4 and reading books on E-book. On another hand, using electronic products for a long time may hurts our health and takes up our times on working and learning.
As far as I am concerned, the first thing I do everyday morning is opening my mobile phone. I believe I need electronic products, as they maks my life convenient, but I won't spend too much time on these thing. After all, learning is the first thing for me now. All in all,electronic products are just some tools to make our life better.

Nowdays, a digital age is coming as the development of science and technology. Digital productions have make a great change on many aspect.
First, nearly every one of us over 18 has a mobile phone. I can't image how time will be if we don't use it. And it must be difficult to communicate with parents far away from us even more, ones we can get in touch with the internet, the world become so small, we can shop, watch movies and chat with others though the internet. Mobile phone and computer, they both make world closer to us. They have play an important role on our life and can't be instead.
In my opinion, every coin has two sides. The fundamental principle of using digital production is to make life easily.we must take full advantage of them,. For example, we should use computer to help us with study. But not play computer games and become addicted.

With the group of people,electric is more times to be used in our daily life.if you want to see some news,the first you think must be watching tv or finding it in the internet but not  reading news paper.if you want to enjoy youself,you can not play basketball because the people who play basketball now are surfing the internet.electric makebig influence in many parts of people life.
I think electric is good for our life.first such as news,one thousand years ago,no electric,and if something terrible happened far away from the capital,government can not know it quickly,but now,only few minutes,present can do anything.then,the age of the people who lives one thousand years ago is very short;because only a cold can make people die,but now,doctors can save more people by the modern electric strument.finally,because of the electric,people daily life become better.
In a word,electric is very good in our life.

We also can use them to enjoy ourselves when we are tired.  But,there are also many students can't use those propoally.

Nowadays there are more and more digital productions, like the cellphone, the computer and so on. As we all know, they have changed our life badly.
On one side, we are working and studying more effectively with these productions. For example, if we want to contact some one far away immediately, we can just call his cellphone whenever and wherever. When we are tired because of the huge pressure, we can relieve ourselves by listening to music from an mp3.It's very convenient. However, on the other side ,as every coin has two sides, these productions also have a bad effect on us. We may lose ourselves in the interesting games in these digital productions. That means we are wasting the best time in our life. So this negative effect is very horrible.
As far as I'm concerned, to find our positions in this modern world, we must control ourselves well and take advantage of these useful digital productions properly.

Nowadays,the number of the elctrical products is increasing rapidly,and they're showed their vital uses of wide range of our life.
Without them,maybe we couldn't get up on time because of the absence of alarm,and we could only ride bicycles or walk to school.We must use candle to light our home at night,the old would be along because TV is never invented.I guess,what's the worst thing is the unavaliable of the computer,more and more people treat computer as a part of their life,the work or study wouldn't be finished without the help of the computer.
In my view,we couldn't lead our life without electrical product,this is a signal of development.But we should try to learn how to survive from the no electricity world in case there is a absence of electricity one day.

With the development of econoy, the digital products have become more and more, so the Digital Age arrives. In the information age, that every people has a cell-phone is virtually realized. I believe that every person will own a computer almost in the future soon. But a number of questions are discovered following these digital products.
Firstly, take cell-phones for example, we can communicate with others easily with the help of them. Secondly, our lives become glorious through TV, computer and so on. But every thing has two aspects as every coin has two sides. With the number of digital products becoming more and more, we are damagined by these all the time. It can cause many disasters like canser.
As far as I'm concerned, we should have a sensible idea toward these digital products. We should limit the time using these products. Only in this way can we develop healthily.

Many people like to buy mobile phones even if they had bought one several moths before. I think these behaviours will have effect on our environment. In my opinion, we should not change digital products so frequently, so select what we like and use it until it's out of work.
Digital products can make our life more convenient, but they also can make human rely on them.

Nowadays, there are more and more electronic products flooding into our daily life, all kinds of type, all kinds of sizes. they are more and more popular in our life in all espects, facing this phenomenon , I feel very worried.
It's certain that electronic products bring us more convinence. Take the electronic dictionary as an example. There are much more words than that we can remember, so it's hard for us to keep every words in our mind, besides, it is impossible for us to take a sticke dictionary hanging around, this time, an electronic dictionary does us a large favor. There are still many other products, which is much useful in our daily life.
But trouble is here, with the help of electronic product, we don't need to remember as much as people befor, many people can get lazier, they may lose their try to do things which they should have done. Further more, when we use electronic products, it means our time will be contritated on it, we don't have enough time to communicate with others, we just adicated ourselves into a world which nobody else can run into. for that, I'm very worried.
With the development of technology it's true that we will be flooded into an ocean of electronic product, but if we take advantage of it, we will benifit so much.

The digital products have a great influence on our life in every aspect. On one hand, they bring us many good things, that is to say, they benefit us, for example, the mobile phone makes it easier for us to communicate with our friends and families as well, and the intellectual phone even has a lot of functions, such as download music, games and movies. These functions enale us to do almost whatever we want, when we want to listen music, we just unfold it and tap it lightly, then we can enjoy ourseleves. But every coin has two sides, the bad effect they take is obviously to see. Many students are addicted to games and ruined their studies, this phenomenon is common in most of schools.
As far as I'm concerned, the digital products' advantages outweigh its disadvantages, if we use them properly, they can make it convenice for us to do almost everything in our daily life. In a word, the digital product itself is neither good or bad, it depends on how we use it. Only by using it properly can we live a better life in the future.

Today, there are more and more digital productions, like digital camera, digital TV, digital wash machine. They are so advanced and so convenient, even them who don't accept so advanced education can operate well with them. Especially, they are so cool, do you think so?
Absolutely digital things make great effect to every aspect of our life. When we go back home, a digital TV is here and we can enjoy the stories happened everywhere so that we will be happy to relax ourself. If we want to go to have a trip, there is a digital cameral, it is so small that we can carry it everywhere and so covenient that we can read the picture we get every time and everywhere. What's more, his pictures even don't need to wash to print, so facinating, isn't it?
I like these very much, after all they are the things what arise because of technology relevotion. They are so interesting that we can find the change from old times to now. They are not only the end of the things what we have long long ago like TV, camera or so, but also a beginning of the things we would never have. They have been a important part in our life, and They will have a more important part.
In the end, I'll say, digital age has came in.

We live in an age of digial.
This age is an age of digital, we can see digital products everywhere and everyday.
Walking on the road, we can see so many people walking with mp3 or walkman. Working in the office, we can't do anything without the computer. Even studing in the classroom. There will be a lot of students using their mobile phones. We can't live with the digital products.
There are so many digital products living with us. As we know, the population of the country of digital products is rising quickly.
Withe the digital products, our life changed a lot. For shopping, we don't need to go to store. Just using the digital product we have, we can surf the Internet, get the information easily and buy things we like. That's easy and cheap. For traveling, we also could get tickets and get information.
I love the digital products, they give us a easy and confort life. Without them I could not do anything.

Now, you will find more and more digital products. You may even never hear about the thing but maybe it will become popular soon.
The digital has influenced our lives. It makes our lives easier. When the view is beautiful, we can take photos. When we don't know the key to solve the problem, we can find the information on the Internet by the computer or even by the phone. And we have to print it and find some knowledge only by books in 100 years ago. We even don't know how big the Earth is but we can fly to somewhere we want only takes few hours now. But on the other hand, the digital makes our environment worse, when we throw it to the labe, the water won't be used for lots of years.
I suppose we should make more digital products, but at the same time, we should make sure the products won't do harms to our environment.

Now, there are more and more electric productions in our life. Some years ago, TVs were in many families. Then mobile phones and computers are more and more common in normal persons.
When the electric productions have more kinds, our life has been changed a lot by it. I have remembered an old electric thing named Radio. It has been welcomed by the old now. It's small and light. People can listen programs over it. The TV may be the most common electric production now. Through it, people can not only listen but also watch pictures.
Computers and mobile phones are used in our life in all kinds of parts. People can nearly do any things by them, such as doing some shopping, communicating with others and working hard. It takes a huge change to us.
I think the electric productions are good. It makes our life more convinient. Even it enriches our sight. But it also lets our a little lazy. When using them, we must keep ourselves healthy. Don't forget we are living in the real world.

The digital things apeared no long, and nowsdays, it is increasing in a high speed. Digital things make a big influence in our daily life, also, it will exist a long time.
As I concerned, it has both good and bad influence on the word, it makes our life more convenient, for example, we can go everywhere in a short time, communicate with others eusier, read the news, buy the goods and so on. If I have a MP4, I can listen to music or watch a movie everywhere and every time. The world is combined together by the modern digital things.
On the other word, it makes our life more nenous. For me, I almost can't live without it. And more and more people use it day and night, it makes a very bad influence to our body, especially our eyes. It also makes a big polution which is unrestored.
Above all, we have to use it in a right way. And we can benefit from it more, our life will be more interesting.

The digital products can give us the great help. for example, we can study listen music, watch movies with computer. We can keep in touch with anyone we want by cellphone. Without the digital products, our livies must be very diffcult.
The digital products really give us many help, but if we don't use them in a good way, it also can bring some trouble. The digital products can do harm to our health. Some digital products can make us miss ourselives. Some digital products even be used to do bad thing. They can also polute the environment. So we must use the digital in a good way.

Nowadays, with the rapid development of science, there are more and more digital productions around us. In every part of our lives, they play a role and make it different.
For example, we can search information by the Internet without going to the library and facing millions of books. When we are working in the office, computers help us to complete the programs easily. Also digital productions make the distance of people very short. We can communicate with others via telephone, email and so on. If we are tired after doing someting, why not listen to some music? That's a good way to relax our body and brain.
I think digital productions make our lives more colorful. They have became part ot our lives.

Now, everybody likes using the computers, the phones and so on. These are all electrical products. There are a lot of products like those we use them. Sometimes, we can't work and study without them. Because they are becoming one part of our lives. So we must have them. And in this sociaty, the products also have many new functions. They're very useful and wonderful. For example, we can communicate with our friends by using the e-mail on the computer. It is very fast. And we listen to music with a little box. It's so cute.
In fact, the electrical products really have large influences with us. We need them everyday. They also bring some problems. For example, the teenagers are hooked in these products. They lose the interests in studying. It's very terrible. And now many people make crimes through the internet. It will be very dangerous. So we should use them by the good ways. We are their masters. We can't be controled by them.
In my opinon, the products are very wonderful. They give us a lot of benifits. However we must use them on the sure ways. We should control ourselves to use them when we need them. So I hope everybody can have good ways to use the electrical products.

We use GPS to find where we are, And we also use ipone to relate each other. And sometimes we play PSP for fun. It is obvious that the digital products have more and more influence on our life. Even, without them, we will lose almost things we have now. So they are important part of the world.
In fact, the digital products make our life beatiful and add more hapness to us. They are very usefull and interesting, so I think we should learn more things about them, or not be far away from them.
The world has changed. Let's build the digital age. What belongs to us!

Nowadays, electronic products flood into our lives, leading us to the digital age. As the science technology develops so fast, more and more advanced electronic products plays a important part in our daily lives, partly replacing some traditional products.
It goes without saying that we can't live without electronic products wether in our daily life or working or study. When reading a so difficult English passage, we may turn to electronic dictionary while in the past. We only had a so thick dictionary, which is so inconvenient to look up. Our TV is developping so fast that we can see it more clearly. Another important use of electronic is our mobile phone which allows us to phone others anywhere. What's more, oh yes, the computer. Computer, which is now occupy much of our life, is widely used in almost every field in our life. We use computers to get resources from internet, to make program to solve problems, to entertain... countable functions.
Undoubtly, my life benefits from the advanced and wonderful products, which bring so many conveniences to my life. I totally expect the faster development of the e-products. I hold the view that the development of electronic products is so helpful for both ourselves and society.
All in all, I think, most importantly, science developping is in the first place. Let me enjoy our digital age.

Nowdays, with the development of the technology, there are more and more digital products in our life. Their appearance brings many benefits to us.
There is no doubt that the digital products make a great effort to our life in many ways. For example, a lot of people like to go sightseeing an holiday. So a camera seems to be necessary. It can help us keep a beautiful memory and so on. On the other hand, mobile phone becomes more important in our daily life. People can communicate with others at anytime. No one can imagine what the world will be if there were no mobile phones. What's more, computer and TV enrich our daily life. When we have a day off, we can watch TV and play computer game at home. In a word, digital products made our life a great fun.
In my opinion, digital products could not only offer fun but also take convinience to us. As a young in 21 century, we should make full use of digital products to achieve our dreams.

Electronic products do massive change to people's live. The influence includes study, work, industry, environment and so on. For example, most of my calssmate write essays on computer instead of writing on paper now, which I was recently. High-technique produce the newest electronic products.
I love electronic products.I have a PSP and a NDS. They are just used to play electronic game, which make me free and happy. Also, studying english and computer need a compiler, which we take it for granted.
That's so on.

And we could see many young people playing their phones on the bus. When tired, many people like to listen to a MP3 for a rest. And most people tend to spend their spare time on television instead of having a joy time with their families. And computers are planning to appear in every room!
We seem to lost ourselves in this digital age. And it is the time we should have waken up to the natural life. We should use digital products but not to lose ourselves in them.

As a moden student, I like to play computer games, listen songs, send short message to others. We should use computer, MP3, MP4 and also hand-phone to do the things as that. We call them e-goods.
E-goods is now really close to us. People make them better and better, and they influence our life deeper and deeper. You can't leave your phone at home for a day, because your family as well as your workmate can't get you as they want. You are not one in the world, you are just a part of the world. If you don't know how to use e-good fill now, I think trouble will always run around you.
E-goods can make our life easyer and faster. The e-goods to us is like the water to the fish. They change our life in everywhere.
I think although e-goods make our life that fast, we can't give up troditional ways of living a life. We should write in pens not only with computers. So I think both troditional way and e-goods are needed. Both they two are important for our life.

Personally, every coin has two sides, e-production is benefit for us, but we can't ignore that is also is harmful to us. So, when we use it, we must find a right way to control.

The digital products bring a lot of enfluences to people in many ways. First, the speed of people's life is faster. With the help of the mobil phone, people can connect with others whenever and whereever they want. People need to communicate face to face no longer. When someone has something emergency, just take out the phone. What's more, people can keep in touch with others by many other ways. Second, people can have fun and get relax by the digital products. People can listen to music, play games, watch movies and so on. For example, the ipad can do almost everything, even play the piano. Third, digital products become one parts of people's life.

Nowadays, many kinds of digital productions are full of our eyes. Like digital camera, mobile phone, computer and so on. As the death of Steven Jobs, the eyelights of public have been attracted by the Apple, for example. And all of these digital prodctions have changed our lives more or less. In order to buy the newest digital productions, somebody even run out of their money. I think that's not sensiable, but, what should I do?
As for me, I think I can't run after the newest digital productions, that's not really sensible. Although they are really fashion and convinnent, I won't do like that. The digital productions are produced to improve our lives, not decrease. So it's okay to buy what I really need. I won't save money for three years to buy iphone 4s, I think that's ridiculos.
So, I agree that the digital productions are good for our lives and works, but don't run after the digital productions, and don't let them affect our lives that should be happy.

With the development of digital technology, there are variety of digital products around our life. Some new products are pretty popular with teenagers, just like iphone, itouch computers and so on. But what about these productions.
Well, it is a good idea for our young to hear that a new digital product has been sold. Because it can make our life more convenient and it's a good thing when we are boring. But it can't drive adults' attention. They are more about vitual life. As to us, digital products do help with study a lot, we can have a shop on line. So different products have different use, to different people, it has different effect.
In my opinion, digital products are suitable for us, but we can't lose ourselves when we use them. Keep a balance is a good choice.

I think computer is one of the most useful digital products. By using computers, we can not only chat with friends who are in other cities very easily, but also do some shopping without leaving home. Telephone is also a fantastic invention. For me, I can not live without it, because it gives me some important information such as news, weather etc.
As far as I am concerned, digital products also have bad effects. Spending too much time on computer is bad for our eyes, so it is important for us to use them in correct ways.
All in all, digital products make our life vivid, terrific and happy.

I do have a lot of electric products such as cellphone, computer, and they all have great influence on my life. MP3 makes it easier for me to enjoy music wherever I am and its large memorise see to it that I could put a great many music on it. Besides, we can use computer to contact other to get a lot of informations so that we have enough ways to solve our problems. There are still so many that electric products have brought to us, so I can not image the life without them.
Much does our life rely on electric products so that they have caused big influence on the world. For them having been making the world easier since the time they entry our life. I wish them a good future.

The digital products have changed people's life greatly. The have great influence to all aspects of life of people. For example, I can't accept the truth that there is no energy for my cell-phone. It's so bad that I will make my cell-phone get energy immediately.
I also like watch TV as I like play cell-phone. And I have much interesting in computer games like DOTA. So the computer is my pet.
I think the most of digital products are good. I like the feeling of the combination of hand and digital product. But we shouldn't pay the most of time to the digital produce or we will be aparted from our friends. We need back into the real world. The most important thing is communicating with people other than mechines.

There is no one can ingore the effect of digital products about our life. Digital products have affect our life in many terms: we can surf on the Internet, listen to the music whereever we are, take photos to save our happy memories.
In my opinion, we can not emphasize the importance of digital products too much. However, people still should be cautions about them. There are so many people who lost themselves cause surfing on the Internet. And people will ignore the existance of world around them easily because they will focus on their own world too much. They may lost the ability of communication. It is terrible.

In every family, the electric method is much more than the past, such as TV, computer, telephone, radio and so on. These things is very useful. For example, I have a computer, and I like it very much, it makes my life more convinent and interesting. If I want to relax my life, I could listen to the music or play games on computer, if I need to find some information about my study, I could check the internet, I needn't go to the library to borrow books or ask my teacher, that is convinent. If I need to hand in my article, I could use the computer to press them, then give it to my teacher, I don't need to write. Computer has a lot of advantages to our life, and so do other electric tools. They can make our work more convinent and fast, and we will have a wonderful and happy life.

with the development of technology, there are more and more E-products such as computers, cellphones and so on, which means that we step into the Digital Age gradually. Totally seen, the E-products give us a great impact.
Everyday and for everyone, we need capture the news and information, and through the computer, we would get them easier and more fast. When I came to another city for college study, I could use my cellphone, which is so convienent and simple, to keep in touch with my family, and also my friends. What's more, I'd like to use my MP3, which is as small as even a cent, to listen music, which relax me and make me free, when I fall in negetive emotion.
However, I think we should spend too much time on them, we should, in my opinion, force ourselves back into the real world, to restore balance to my life, that is mean, we should not focus only on the E-products and ignore the other more important things.

If the car travels 100 metres without the driver confirming thier ID Cone of the digital products, the system will send a signal to an oparatuous centre that  it has been stolen. It is surprised, isn't it?
And digital photo, it can make some pictures with more beautiful. It can contain many pictures.
But every coin has two sides, why?
Computer games is typical.
Some students is  engaged in it. They hate study and classmate. So, we must make some rules to control it.

Nowadays, digital products are around our living and even everybody get up with a clock. It would be so normal that you work with your own computer witch can't be imaging ten years ago. And we study, work and play with them. We can say that we can't leave them for one day. If you don't have a computer you may have TV to watch. But what if not. I think you may have a phone and even me a student have a phone now. So, they are here and there around us. They are everywhere.
And they make great efferts in our daily life. We may say they changed our life or they are changing our life. That is why the IPHONE is cheaper than before, the digital products develop fast. A computer you buy last year may be out today. So, maybe, we shouldn't buy a new computer and wait for one year. OK, that's a joke. It proves how fast the digital products develop and change our life.
Asuming that one day without electricity, you and me may be not happy or angry. Although, we get a easy life now. We should also think more. And we should not rely on them too much. You can have a day without a phone and a computer. Just get closed to the nature and have a rest.

Today, there are more and more electric machines appearing in our life. And it is changing our life in many ways and make our life comfortable. For example, computer. When this kind of machine was first in our eyesight, it was huge and not easy to use. But now, it has been the centre of our life. It help us to trackle data quickly and give us many ways to relax ourselves. With the Internet, the world becomes smaller and smaller.
Anything can't be good in anyway. So when the electric machines give us morden life, they also change us. They make us lazy. When machines can do some works which is dirty and hard instead of human, people don't do it by themselves. When sometimes, the machine is break out, people would find they can't do it without machine.
So, in my opinion, when we face the electric machine, we need use them in right way. And we can't use it in any ways. Because we are the master of machines.

Time come to today. Our world becomes a digital world. Many digital produces flood to us, such as MP3, MP4, computer and phone. Almost every people have one digital produce at least, even some people maybe have more. Using digital produces becomes one part of our life, and in the fact, they are more helpful to us and make our life more convirniet and wonderful.
As the matter of fact, the digital produces influence our life not with only one aspect.
The digital produces can help with our work. For example, we can use the computer to deal with many digital. We can use the computer to write something and save something which is very important to us. We can also use computer to send a email to another. Sometimes, a phone can help us communicate with other people everywhere, so it's very convinient for us to inform others or get some information for ourselves.
The digital produces can also help with our study. We can use computer to make something, which is difficult for us to write with a pen. We can use computer to talk with our teacher and ask them some questions.
In my opinion, I think the digital is very helpful to us. But, we should use them in a proper way. We shouldn't use computer only for games. I think, if we can make good use of digital produces, they may become a good helper for us.

Nowdays, the digital products flood into our life. It affects us in almost every aspect. We can communicate with our distant friends by cellphone and Internet instead of mailing. We can recieve the information from all over the world by just a computer. We can listen to music by MP3 and watch movies by MP4.
Unsuspectly, the digital products have totally changed our life. It changes the distance, the time and especially the lifestyle. Though a friend is thousands of kilometers away from us, we just fell that he or she is just near us. Something has been history, but we can feel it again by video, we needn't get together to have fun, for we can have fun on our own.
I think that the digital age bring great convinience to our life. It reveals the great wisdom and ability of humans. We should enjoy it.

Some digital products help us know about the world, such as computer, TV. Some make our lives more easier, like telephone. And some become a part of ourselves. All of them make a great differences.
As a student, my life fill of a lot of digital products. I use mobile telephone to communicat with my friends, my teachers, my family, and, the world. I listen to the mp3 player when it my spare time. Sometimes, I surfur the net, playing, studying and so on. They are important in my life.
But some bad things happen because of the digital propucts. People become lazy to do things with hands, and some people are lack of face to face communicates. because they can get in touch with others with telephones or computers.
So, in my opinion, the digital products is neither bad nor good. It's depend on what and how we use them to do!

Just think about it 10 years ago. Most of us had no idea about laptop. And now, even a primory school student is able to have a cellphone which has as many functions as a laptop! Almost everyone has got MP4, iPod, high price digital camera... They make our lives so convinient, we can call others whenever we want and celebrate friend's birthday in distance.
But on the other hand, children use them for games in the class, or chating during the exams, so that some of the parents don't let their kids own them.
In my opinion, I think digital life is just the tendence that our world to has to develope, how can we live on this planet whish is full of imformation without these things? So what parents should do is teaching their children how to make a good use of digital things rather than baning using them.

Just pay attention, we can find that the digital productions have influenced all aspect of our life.
As we all know, as the digital production takes a lot of convenience, it also has bad effect on our life, for example, we are easy to depend on the production that makes ourself lazy and also there are a lot of bad message that influence our healthy.

In addition, the mobilephone is widely used to contact friends, collegues and families. What's more, almost everyone is equiped with a mp3, which is designed for listening to the music.
As far as I am concerned, the digital products affect our daily life indeed. In most cases, I believe that the digital products assist us in many aspects.

With the technique going quickly, there are too many electrical products now. They influence our life much. By the electrical products, we can eat ice-cream in summer, we can do the waches not by our hands. we can listen to the CD and don't need to listen to himself or herself. We can spend a happy time by the TV when we don't have any important things to do. We can do shopping at home by the computer and don't need to go to the shopping center. 
In my opinion, the electrical products do make our life easier. But with the birth of them, people become lazier. The balance of people's health is broken. People don't want to move at all gradually. Many people get up a even at noon. It means they can't eat breakfast. And in the afternoon, they don't want to move either. They may do all the things in the bed! So, the electrical products do good and do bad too to our daily life. We should use them in the right way.

In classroom, we use computer and the telecomuter will help us to complete the teaching assignment. And a singer can record her melody with an Iphone which is as small as a hand... Digital product influnced our lives anyway.
As far as I am concerned, even the digital product do make our lives more colorful, but we still have to make balance between real world and virtual life. Phone and MP3 is not not everything, but a tool, it should be our charge, not our master. So we should find a way which lead us to get a more natural life style.

Today, eletricitical products can be see everywhere. More and mor detricitical products are appearing in our lift. We need them when we work, study, cook even sleep. In the fact, human have life with eletricitical product.
When we work, we need a computer to assist us. Because computer can work out the datas the human can't do. Almost every house have a TV, it is a important think of a family. And today, everyone have a phone. it is reduce the distant from people to people.
I think eletircitical product benfits to human. It can incream the relavotion. For example, I can go to the college in Hefei, but I still see my mother on the computer every. It is a good use of human. Everythink is fantasty, when the eletricitical product go into as lifves.

In this century, more and more electrical productions are producted out. If everything is okay, the speed of producting will be much faster than before.
There will be too much electrical production, so they will influent human's lives very much. For example most people have their mobile phone now. People prefer to communicate with each other by telecommunication rather than go to other's house and have a chat face to face. So these electrical productions have changed humans' habit of communication. And in the way of searching for information, electrical productions have big infulence too. Many years ago, people usually went to library to find a professional book to look up information. But in this day, most people prefer to surf the Internet to look up information. It's more convenient than old way.
So it's apparent that electrical productions are important in our dail life. But in my opinion, there are alse some probllems. More and more people are over weight, and much of them wear glasses. Some of people only know how to communicate with each other by electrical production, but they have no skills in communicating with real people. All of those are happend because of a large amount of electrical production. So I think these productions are important and necessary, but people also need to use some trditional productions, maybe the traditional productions will take longer time, but we will lose more without them.

nowadays, There are more and more digital products in our society, such as TV, digital camera, computer and so on. Electrical products make great influence for our own. For example, your parents are Beijin now, and you are in Newyork. If you miss them, you only need to call them. but in ancient days, That's impossible.
There are both advantages and disadvantages on electrical products. Firstly, electrical products, especially Internet, make the world smaller and smaller, we can communicate with someone anytime and anywhere. but, electrical products sometimes make teenagers be in danger, crime on the Internet is typical.
In my opinion, I think disadvantage of electrical products is essential, Without these products, we may be near with nature instead of surfing on the Internet everyday. Without nature instead of surfing on the Internet everyday, without electrical products, we may have many closely friends. So I believe more and more digital products are bad for our society and are harmful with our health and soil.

"21st century is the digital age." someone say. And it turly is.
In recent ten years, digital products have flooded into our life, and it's becaming more and more. From BB machine to mobile phones, from PC to lap-top, our life becomes more and more colorful for these lovely ones.
Such a large number, and such a wide range, there is no doubt, that such big influence it has. Ten years ago, we worte letters, today, we use e-mail. Ten years ago, we depended on the map, nowadays, we have GPS. So, isn't it really bid influence?
But are all the impacts good? I don't think so, but so what? One thing is good or not depending on the one who use it, so is the digital product. For me, it is really very very great progress, but how to use it still rely on we humans. Why not open your hearts to welcome the digital age?

With the development of the science and technology, the electric produts are more and more useful, and they also are used in our life fast.
The most change in our life is the way of communication. We can only send letters to each other to keep in touch with others in the past. But now, we can not only communicate with others by computer, but also we take a cellphone with us which can help us talking with others at any places and any time. It's very convinent for us to keep in touch with others.
What's more, the electric product change the way we slove problem. In the past, we must calculate much of numbers and deal with information by our mind. But now, we only need use a software on computer, which can manage a lot of digital number. Therefore our work efficent is much more than without electric product.
Hence, at the digital age, our work point and work style have a basic change compare with the past. And electric product make our life more comfortable and convinent.
Even though it will pollute environment at produce the electric product. and there are large of dangerous in use electric product for example hackers, we also stick in the digital age. Because the electric product have a lot of profit much more than their harm.

Now we have come to the digital age, more and more kids of digital has been producted and we use that ever where. For example: the computers, digital camera, mobilphone and so on, they are surrounding around with us.
Digital had made a lot of effections to people's life in many ways. With the development of digital we us it more and more. Only computers can change human's life a lot. You want to let someone know something, if you have a computer only sent a e-mail for one minute, not sent a mail for many days. You can play games or do work use computer, it more faster. And for other digital such as camera, we needn't to make a draw to save what we want, only have a "click" with a finger.
I think digital is well, it can help us do many things, faster and more simple. But for many things we shouldn't always do with it, we should use digital but not use it do all things.

considering that have many company product the electrical more and more now. I'd like to put foward some idears, through which we may have a better understanding about how to make the electrical in reduce, because I think reduce product the electrical and the Air should more and more clean. So that we may get better along on the road of life.
As a matter of fact, It is have a big influence people life that product the electricical. Besides, such as "Game boys", "PSP" and "SP", many many electrical both infuluence the people life, Whatever the kids and adults.
However, what's more important is that many electricical infuluence more and more student to play "PSP" but don't study, and product more electricical should can prolution our Air and our environment, prolution our river and many clean water. in reality, if students love study and don't play the "PSP", I thik their parents should can very happy. if the factory reduce the electricical, I thike the river should can more and more wide, more and more clean. and I think if our can to do this, I think that all is making our life more meaningful and rewarding.
Therefore, in my own opinion, only when we can control our life and take someting in our life, such as student can study, our Air more clean. and both can we guaratee a brilliant future.

With the development of our lives, digital productions becoming more and more popular. You can see them almost at any market. And they do have a strong effect on our lives.
MP3, MP4, MP5, these things can make us listen music or watch movies at wherever and whenever we like. Lap-tap is very useful and conviently for both studying and working. Mobile-phones now not only can contect with others on many kinds of ways but also can surf the net, play varies exciting games, even make a ppt for needing.
Actually say, digital productions make our life colourful, but they sometimes can lead us to an unright way. Communication that not just take place by using digital things, but you have to do it face by face. And they may let many people addict to play with digital things and lose the balance between real and virtue life. So I think we need the digital productions, but we can not depend on it too much.

The electronic products are diversity from portable walkman such as MP3, MP4 and cellphones to smart phones and portable computer. With so many electronic products to be chosen, our life has been greatly affected in every aspect.
They influence the ways of relexing, we can use MP3 to listen to music, use computer to watch movies and play computer games, listed just a few.
Also, they have changed our ways of communicating. For example, we can use smart phones to chatt with each other. We can keep in touch with each other throw e-mails. What's more we can use QQ, MSN and so on to chat without expense.
Of course our study tools have been greatly influenced. We can use internet to learn on-line course, and search imformation related to our major. Another important use is that we can download pdf and books of our teacher, to name just a few.
As far as I know, electronic products also have side effects and can do harm to our study such as internet and games addiction. But as long as we use them wisely, they are of great value to our life.

With the development of digital products, many impacts are emerged in our lives. First, we can communicate person very convenient. Second, we can find any imformation what we want to know. Third, we can listen to music to relieve our nevours mind.
As it to me, I hold an optimistic attitude to these. With digital products, we can make our lives more intersting and abundant. We can communicate with others better through it. In a word, I think it's beneficial to us and we need digital products.

It's a fact our lives have been occupied by digital products as the amount of them increase ripidly. It seems that we would not live any longer without them. No one can deny that the digital products have change our life a lot for the washing machine free our hands, the cellphine make communicate more easily and , of course, the computer put the world together, just like a villege.
Although the digital products can help us everywhere, sometimes they do much worse than we expected. Just like a compute, so familiar and useful to us that we can hardly do everything without it , always attrack teens so much that children prefer chatting with others on the net to going out to meet a friend. That's do great harms to the children's physical health. Still worse, some teens absence on the class and go out to play computer games.
For another example, the cellphone, which is also widely used over the world, even a 7-year-old kid would take it, also disturbs our work and study. It is know to us that we can use a cellphone surffing on the net and there are quite a lot of interesting mobile games. While we are working or studying, carrying with a cellphine, we can't concentrate much on what we are doing. That's TERRIBLE!
The digital age make our life more convenience, but it also bring about many problems. It's quite important for us to find the balance of make use of digital products. After all, what you did depends on what you wanted.

Nowadays, the digital productions are more and more popular for us. It is changing our life widely.
The digital productions have a great influnence in human's life. For example, instead of newspapers, we have more choices to get imformation, such as redio, television and so on. Besides, we have more ways to entertain. It really makes our life more colorful. What's more, it is these digital productions that make the communication so convenient. With the tools improving, sending message by birds has been an ancient story.
In my opinion, the digital productions do improve the level of our life largely. We really get a lot through them. But, to be honest, there are also an amount of people addicted to them. It is harmful for us. So I think we should use them properly. I believe if we can do this, we can benifit from the digital productions.

Nowadays, we human have developed to "the digital age". Electrical productions are more and more that we can see them anywhere; the television, the mobilephone, the fridge, the air-condional and so on. To a very extent, they are making our life better and better.
In the early age, we couldn't communicate with the people far away from us as soon as we wanted; we must wear so many clothes in winter to keep our body warm; we had to buy fresh food every morning, so much so that we had a unconvenient life. But later the scientists invented the telephone so we can talk to our families or friends at anytime we want. The air-conditional is made to wear a few clothes in our houses just like in summer. And the fridge appears to keep the food fresh that we can go to the shopping mall once a week. Above all there is no doubt that the computer is the most helpful electrical produt we have ever made. With computer, we can do almost everything: order food, book rooms, play games, make friends ...
I think the electrical products are becoming the necessities in our life. We can't imagine the life without them. They are the vital things to our world.

As we all know, the 21st centry is the age of the digit. The digital age is coming. Nowadays, there are more and more kinds of digital products in the market.
People who can live a life without digital product are endangerous. For example, most people have cellphones. It is convinient for people to call friends and families. If you don't bring your phone a day, you will do everything without energy. As well as computer, people can use computer not only for bisiness but for fun. In the digital age, informations are very important to people. So many digital products can get informations in the internet, like laptop, pad and so on. Their common thing is that you can bring them everywhere, so that is very convinient. People can use these digital product wherever they want.
In my mind, digital products are products of development of science and technology. In this digital age, digital products bring convinience for us, and people can save lots of time. But in other hand, a great number of digital products must take may digital rubbish to our life. Like some bad informations, and many young man drawn themself in suing digital products. They can't do any thing without digital products. All in all, I think we should use digital correctly. We use digital products, not digital products use us.

In the past, people communicate with others only by paper. They hear from other once a week or even longer. But now, almost everyone have a phone. We can communicate with other wherever we are and whenever we want. That's very convinerent.
The television and computer also have a important effect on our life. We can know the news from America just setting down and putting the button. We can know almost everthing in the Internet.
There are much more example that the digital products change our life. In my opinion, the digital products have some disadvantages, but the advantages is much more than the disadvantages. The digital products is the sympol of the prograss we take on technology. I like digital product.

Nowadays, more and more digital products have been rushed to our lives. Nearly all the college students have their own computers. So how we use these resources becomes a problem.
Digital products have made huge influences to each part of people's daily lives. Although many of them provide us convenient and make our lives colourful, a large sum of students are dropped into the internet, computer games or cell phone games. Of course, internet is useful for us to find anything we want to knwo. Some people can make good use of it, but others probably may not. Many students, especially college students, surf the internet to play DotA, Counter Strike, etc. Their parents prevent them from on-line gmaes before high school. Once they come to college, they think no one can stop them. They destroy their whole lives!
Another example is that, the cell phone made 10 years ago is only used to call another. But now there are many menus in our own phone. Some students use it to send messages all day or play games. It's a waste of time. These functions let them down.
Digital products are good. But in my opinion, their danger is more than their befefits to us.

In nowdays, the number of digital productions is increasing, almost everyone has a kind of modern digital production, like digital camera, digital telephone and so on. And there are many kinds of digital productions, which cover our lives, and they do make a great change for our lives.
For example, the modern phones make a great contribution to communication, they do premote the communication. As the development of the science, we can even see each other when talking in any time! Besides, digital cameras make the photoes much clear, and the modern music players make the music more fantanstic. So we have to say, digital productions make a great influence on any aspect of our lives.
As for as I'm concerned, there are both advantages and disadvantages about it. One can be addicted to the games of the modern productions. But after all digital productions make our lives more convienent and more relaxing and much easier, that is true. And no one can hold back the development of the digital productions.

Now, the number of digital production is becoming bigger and bigger. Everywhere in our life is filled with digital production. So the digital production is an important part in society.
The digital production takes a lot of change. For example, we used to take news from newspaper but now we only need a telephone and we can know everything all over the world as soon as it happened. The digital production makes our life more "clever". But, as time goes by, also many problems. Everyone can get your peosonal message on internet. And even many people use the modern digital production to steal the code for Visa and mastercard.
Also the digital production makes a big improvement to our life, but they can't help us do anything. In many important problem, we can only believe ourselves. Above, the digital production is only a machine. We can use it, but we can't depend on it.

In the last decade, telephone is only used for calling and sending messages. With the time goes by, telephone has many different functions now, you can use it to taking photos, receiving e-mails, booking a room and so on. The most fantastic is I-phone which is created by Steve Job's team.
The computers also have a big change. As for CPU, the Intel creates Core series. And the computer is more and more slimer than before. Some manufacters even use bamboos to make a computer.
Other digital products also changed lot. With the development of science, our life is more conveneience and colorful. But also, it brings a lot of problems, like the polluting problems, even damage to our health.
I think development of the digital products is a good thing. It makes our human-begings make a progress. But we should take good care of the problems it brings.

For example, phone make it conveniently to communicate with each other. Internet gives us news everyday. But then, we may waste time to play unuseful games with Internet or even on the phone. It doesn't worth playing those games.
Generally, we should use the digital products on their right way. We are supposed to use it for good, not for evil.

Our world has been changing faster and faster because of the digital products.
Now the digital products are so massive that we can not list them all. But we can deeply find the effect the digital products have. For example, Mp3 player, Mp4 player and so on make us relaxed during the boring working time. The mobile phone makes the communication fast. The protable computer is convinient to acquire lots of information when and where for us. In a word, the digital products have an effect on all sides of people's life.
I think the digital products have made our life more convinient and in the future they will have more influnce. Although the digital products have many advertagements, their bad effect also exits. Some students cheat with the mobile phone result from the mobile phone's function. Even though the digital products have good and bad, I think they will still exit in our life.

Nowadays, more and more digital products appear in the market, they have made a great difference in every aspect of people's lives. I'm happy to see this scene.
The reason are simple. First, that many and varities of digital products can be goods on stores instead of pictures on paper or even images in mind shows the science and technology progress our human has made. We all know that science and technology is the most important force of producing. So with the progress we've made, I believe we can also make values or further progress in every aspects to make our lives from good to better.
Second, it meets people's material and individual needs. We are in a developing country. It's nature that not all goods we want can be enough and easy to get. But the full of digital products shows we are truely developing and at least in this field, our needs is gradually got.
In the end, I can responsiblely say that the digital products have made our lives easier. We can now get any information before the desk through Internet. We can enjoy music wherever we are or whatever we're doing. We can relax ourselves at any break of work by game in the phone...... All these above would be a dream decades ago, but at the digital age we enjoy their benefit every now and then, doesn't we?

Just like every coin has two sides, the digital product has many positive effects on our daily life, but it's negtive effects on us should not be neglected.
Every year these are a large amount of money sucked in digital manufactor. The phenomenon can make it clear that digital product has been a part of modern people's life. Somehow, it's truly offering us many enjoyments. We can enjoy music without going to music concert, we can talk with others without facing each other, and we even can stay at home but dealing all the affairs if we bother the bustling world outside. Totally, the digital age makes our life more convinent.
However, many teenagers losing themselves in computer games. They don't pay attention to their study, they spent much time on computer which mins all their life. On the other side, some young people like to get race of development of digital product, they changed telephone, computer and music player off and on, it caused great fanicial problem to their family, the discarded digital product may lead to bad affect on environment as well. Thirdly, we use cellphone, computer and email to communicate with our family and friends, without emotional cues, how to keep the love and warm between us?
So it is a must for us to have the ability dealing good relationship between real life and digital life, we should make good use of digital products as well.

We would never have imagined that we enter the digital age if we had live in 1980s when our nation started developing ecology. No doubt that digital productions make our lives better and better.
The digital makes our world really fascinating! Some person even can't live without them. At home, we could watch TV to have fun. In the school, we may us a variety of electric tools such as MP4, CD-player even out-of-date walkman to improve an English learning. In company, we may use computer to store some files and do with some matter. Even in travel we can't leave the digital camere at home. Above all, we can use a lot of electric productions to communicate with our friends, our relatives and our classmates. They have really steped in to our lives. Take telephone for example, virtually everyone keeps one!
Not so far, digital production also bring some problems. More and more people typed on the computer instead of writing by hands. A large amount of teenages play computer games day and night ignoring their school work.
In all, I think the digital productions do make our society develop. Meanwhile, only do we have a right attitude towards it, can we live a much better life. It all depends on ourselves!

The 21 century is the digital age. When you wondering in streets, you can find that every supermarket has electronic prodections, such as Mp3, Mp4, Mp5. Computer has come into almost every family many years ago. If someone told you he hadn't used a computer, you must be astonished and feel sorry for that.
Electronic productions have changed our life, but you can't feel it. Without a mobile phone, we are even afaid to be lost in the city. We suffer the Internet at least once a day to chect our e-mail, read news and buy some goods we think cheaper sometimes. Of course, you can relax yourself on the internet, after all, there are many games and movies.
I'm favour of digital production approaching and combining with our life. Sine that it can make our life more convenient, we can't refuse it.

Nowadays, the digital products came flooding bakc to our life and became more and more widing. As a result, people's life has had a great change.
Some years ago, you couldn't see some people taking a CD player to listen music unless he is very wealthy. After a few years, you could see someone take a walkman to listen music. However, if you ask a middle student that he has used an MP3 or MP4, even MP5, they will think you are a litter crazy. And, the computer has been thinner and thinner, even the telephone isn't what it was. so people's life has been fit with much more changes.
In my mind, digital products take some funny to our life, but they still have their disadvantages. For example, for a student, due to the computer, some of them gave up their study to play computer games, so that they would get a bad grade.
Maybe digital products have been good for our life for anyway, but we have had use them in a wrong way. As a word, if we use digital products correctly, they will become your friends.

Nowadays, digital product has gained popularity among people especially college students. So the factories are crazy about producing digital product. At the digital age, MP3, MP4 and camera aren't enough fashionalbe.
Digital manufacture makes great effect on people lives' every aspect. It enriches our relaxed activities, deeply. We can have a cup of coffee or tea while listen to the music after work or class to enjoy ourselves quietly, or maybe we can play games on computers madly on weekends. Of course, the digital products are also used in office and many other fields. All in all, digital product plays a vital role in our lives. Without it, society might come back a lots.
However, in my opinion, I think we should use them correctly in the digital age. At the college, the first important task for us is study, we come to our ideal university while away from our hometown remotely only to seek for the knowledge. Therefore, we should treat the digital product correctly and enjoy ourselves at right time by it. At last, I hope the digital industry develop more and more wonderfully.

At present, more and more digital machine come to our life because of the development of the science and techology, and the prize of them are cheaper and cheaper so that it offers a way for more people to use them.
These digital machines make great influence to every aspect of life. For example: the invention of television is great, for that it helps us the know more things, we can know news, and we can watch movie, we also can watch football match, it is a good a cheap way for public entertainment. Mobile phone is also a good invention. Which competition of the phone company, the phone is more intelligent and more samll. But it is more powerful. Not only we can call others by using phone, we can surf the Internet whenever and wherever, and for bussinessmen, they can check their E-mail and send E-mail. It's very convenient! And the computer is the most inportant thing. It help us do many things, edit PPT, save image, video and so on. We also can use it to work, when we tired, we can use it to play music. It's powerful!
In my opinion, digital machine is useful and powerful, it makes our life more convinent and intelligent. But there are many bad product such as games, some people play games day and night and become more and more antious and they attack others.
In a word, we should use the digital machine to improve ourselves!

Now the digital age is comming! Now the digital produces are more and more. For example, every both have a mobile phone. And some people have MP3 or MP4. So they affect all kinds of life very much. For example, we can't leave mobile phone everty day. Because we can communicate with another people by it. You can't think of the consequense that living without mobile phone. And we can explore some news on the Internet by mobile phone. It's fantastic! And now they are many kinds of movies and musics. So we can put these files into MP4. We can take MP4 and move anywhere.
I think digital produces are so great! It's good for out lifestyle. But sometimes they are bad for our studying and working. Some students play mobile phone in the names of communicating with their parents. And some people play computer games and finally get a failing grade. So I think we can use digital peoduce after we are tired, they can relieve our mind! But don't play them everytime!

Every day, I surf the Internet to know what happened in every corner of the world and chat with my friends by QQ and MSN. Most importantly, I can download many learning materials from the Internet, which are very helpful on my study.
However, every coin has two back. I also troubled by the electrinical products in some real extent.

At the digital age, nobody is still equipped a walkman to listen to the music, because nearly all the electronic products have the function of media player. They are much smaller and more convenient to take.
Apart from media player, I have a digital camera, people used to take photo by cameras with films, and they used to develop the films, it's so complex. Nowadays, I take photos by my digital camera and we can easily see my photos on the computer screen and if we like, we can print them  easily.
Nearly every student has a mobile phone, twenty years earlier, we had to communicate face to face or by letters. five year ago, we are able to talk through the phone, but now we can do a lot of things through the mobile phone, such as surfing the internet , reading books and so on.

Although this issue being discussed is a complex and controversial one. I strong agree the benefit of the digital product.
In the first place, the reason why I have such a view is that it is convinient for our life. It can't be denied that the Internet, cell phone is the symphy of the third techlogital revolution. To illustrate this point, here is a account that is persuasive: we can't live with so convenient style in the collage.
In the second place, what imagine if you don't use computer, you may be can't study and even don't know what class you need to learn.
Consequently, due to the reason mentioned above, we should to accept and use the digital product with the digital age coming.

With time going, the technic grows fast. There is a current fact that the electric products are more and more. In our life, we estimated can't leave them. And at the same time, they have great effects on our life on a large extent.
for example, everynight, people with turn on lights, so that we would get an appropriated sight. As we all know, in the early years, the public have not so many activities at night. They just chatted with each other or slept. Of course, the moon light and some other things could offer people light. But in fact, it was not convienent, and only part of people could use. What's more, someone likes Walkman, because it is small and can be taken to everywhere. And more than millions of people use computers for work and so on.
The electric products can be find everywhere. In my opinion, electric products not only give us good effects, but also give us many problems. So we must do with them sensible. Please believe: using them in proper way!

But on the other hand, maybe nighty percent students spend so much time on playing games rather than studying. These students use the digital products in a wrong way. The digital industry also leads to polution.
All in all, the digital products give us more benefits.

Today Science and technology of all over the world develop fastly. Digital technology's developing makes more and more digital products.
Digital changes our life, it has a great influnee to people's daily life, Such as PC, phones, mp3, and so on. With the step by science, these are more fit on people. About 10 years ago, personal computera were so big, they were very slow. The color was single. But now, firstly, computer changes into ghinner and thinner. You can use it to listen to music, play games on Internet, see a movie. Maybe you can have a talk face to face with a foreign friend. The pictures are also like truth. That's amazing!
In my opinion, digital products is so great. It can help people do many things, that people want to do and cannot do. But people should not depenee on digital. People should have daily life, study from book, and touch the beautiful nature. That makes you have a healthy body and a bright brain.

In 21 centry, we are live in a high-tech centry. Now the day, electrical goods have more and more kinds. Like MP3, MP4, mobile phone, IPAD, computer...These things are afford our life in many forms. Some are good and some are bad. Forthe electrical goods how to afford our life, it's depende on how to use it. For example, the Internet, when the Internet was born, the earth became "smaller". we can know the news from the country far away from us in secends. It is very nice and we can have more time to do other things. But the Internet also have the  bad way. Many students play the online game and lose theirselves. The go into the victoral and don't study. Some students even don't  sleep all the day. It is not only bad for their study but also bad for their health. 
So we should know the right way to use the electrical goods in our life.

Now, more and more digital age came to our eyes, such as walkman, mp3, telephone, computer and so on.
Digital age let our life changed so much. I can listen to music at everywhere and everytime but not only goto concerts when their are some musicians at here. I can chat with my friend while we are far from each other alone hungred of miles. I can gee informations about everywehere when I am at home. It says: Reading lots of books is not better than traveling lots  of place; traveling lots of place if not better than watching lots of people; watching lots of people is not better than being taught by a good teacher. But now, someone said a joke that being taught by a good teacher is not better than surfing in the "baidu".
I think, digital age changed our life a lot. it let many things be easier, but it also let our life be faster and faster. we became lazy because  of it, we can't do many things leaving digital age because of it, we are easy to forget because of it. Digital age is not always good, but we can't leave it.

As we all know, digital produces are more and more popular on the grounds of the highlight of technique development. That is to say, we are in the digital age.
Those produces have a great effect on our daily life. With those produces using in a right way, it is more and more convenient for us to watch a film and listen to music even communiate with our friends to develop our friendship. What's more, we can study with them.
Being different, we students don't like our parents, runing against the grain of thing up to date. I think highly of the digital produces and we should strike out a wide path on these produce in this age.

Nowadays, the number of electronic products and the kinds of electronic products are increasing day by day. With time going by, more and more people use them. Now I have to say, we can live without them.
Electronic products have a big influence on every field that humans live in. We can't stand we can't contact with our families whenever I want. Of course, we can't bear the unefficiency of letters. And we can surf the Internet to keep our informed, knowing current events on time. We also can play computer games and watch TV when we tired.
But, as any coins have two sides, the electronic products have bad effect on our life. They can break the balance of our life, pushing our into an unreal world.
So, I suppose that we should make full use of the convienient that they bring to us. On the other hand, we can't lose ourself in them.

There are more and more digital products with the developments of technique and science.
Digital products have influenced us in differents ways. First, It makes our life much more convinent. we can talk with our friends or families no matter where we are by a cellphone. Second, we can get the latest news over the global. You can just stay at home and click some key words and get flooding information quickly. Third, some ditital dolls may help to educate our children and improve their intellenge level. Child may divide a digital car into servel parts to explore how it works.
While, every coin has two sides. There are also much digital pollution every where espailly battery pollution.
I think it not a easy work for us human to create or use digital products rightly even though we have done it. Careness is always needed.

With time goes by, we have come to the 21st century, to a great extend, we could call it "the digital age".
With the development of science and technology, the number, kind of the digital products have come to a new height. Almost everywhere, we could find digital product. In our home, almost every family has TV and computer. Also almost everyone has a mobile phone. The exist of these products makes our life more quick, more easy, more comfortable and more convenient.
But on the other hand, we also find the nagative influence of them, just like every coin has two sides. The rely of the digital products makes our human become more lazy, more fool and even more unhealth.
So, what should we do in using digital products?
Use them in limit. Not everythings we should use them, we could finish these thing by ourselves.
Use them cleverly. This means we should use them in a right way.
If we could use them in these ways, I think digital products can make our life more and more better.

In the digital age, more and more electrical productions have been made today, for example, almost every students in our college has no less than one call phone, and some of them has even computer, MP4 or ipad, so digitals effect all kind of our life. We can't live without them.
It's convinient of us to use digital in our life, we could use them to solve many problems that we don't want to solve, and we also can use them to enjoy our life. Think of this, I can watch a movie on my bed with ipad, how wonderful.
But on the other hand, digitals made us lazer and lazer. More and more students prefer computer games to study, and they don't like sport either. They can stay at home the whole day. It's harmful to theirselves.
So we must control ourselves, we can use it, and enjoy it. but it's not the reason for you to break the basic of your life.

As the social development, digital products come flooding to our life, which have made a significant influence to us.
For example, almost everyone owns a mobile phone now, which makes communication become much easier than before. Many friends can be kept in touch by telephone or the Internet. The Digital Age makes distance not a problem. Also, we can get an unbelievable large of information through the Internet by a computer or even a mobile phone. Reading, studying and even seeing a doctor can be finished on line.
However, people who rely much on digital product do not feel all content. After too much time on line, they feel it unreal about the world. And addict to virtual life is able to result in drug abuse, crince and suiside according to the investigate. Therefore, convenience is a good thing, but we can't addicted to a virtual life. After all, the real world is most important.

In my opinion, It's a signal that people make great progress in technology, which makes our lives more effictial and convenient. In the meantime, they also promote the combine of the whole world. I think it is a great progress in human's history.
but, coins have two sides. They also bring all kinds of pollutions which almost makes our earch death. So I think we should use the technology in the environment more to protect our mother - earth.
I believe, if we use it well, the technology will make our lives better.

The digital tool is not designed for long, but now they have a great influence on all aspects of people's life. For example, we use mp3 to listen to music and often watch movies on mp4.
However, I think the digital age is a two-way-street. Most of us feel happy by using them. But, in fact, we should be more cautious, for many students "fall in love with the computer". That is, the digital tools are useful and necessary but they are just tools.

Obviously, the digital products have made a great effort on many aspects of our life. Officers use them to communicate with each other, to copy or type a important file; to deliver a report to public. Students use them to listen music, to learn, our mom use them to cook. In other words, we couldn't live without them now!
Personally, as every coin has two sides. I got a different view on them. We could deny the digital products represent the improvence of our society, but some one could do crimed thing by them. As we are surrounded by "digital eyes" in every corn, it is impossible or difficult to conserve our privaties which provide a good chance to crimers.
In a word, we should use the digital products in sensible.

We use them to keep up with the latest news, to get information, to keep in touch with our friends who live far by e-mail. Third, the TV-set is becoming our mailly way to enjoy ourselves by watching TV programs.
For me, I think digital machinges are important to us, but they also have some bad effects. Many young people sucked in them can't come back to real life. So we should use them cautious.

It can't ignore that digital products have much influence in our life in many aspects. For example, the cellphone help us communicat with others more easily, the air-conditional helps us living more comfortable, and with computer's help, we can get information more easily. In a word, the digital products make our life more easy and comfortable. But just as each coin has it's two side. We also can't ignore digital products' disadvantage. We spend more time on watching TV or playing computer game etc. So that our eyesight is more and more poor, our body is more and more sicky, and our life is more and more pale. It's very bad.
In my opinion. digital products are very important in our life. We can't live without them. But I think it's unhealthy if we depend them to much. Many people find happy in digital products only, it's too bad. We should find the life's happy from nature, friends or family and so on, but not all from digital products. In a word, face the digital product, we should be sensible user.

With the development of society, our living quality is much better than ever before. Nowadays, there are more and more electrinic productions. Such as MP3, MP4, cellphone and so on. This suggests that the digital age is coming.
There are so many digital productions in our life and they have an important influence on our life style. For example, when will go out for a vacation, we can drive a car to the destination by a digital production which has GPS by ourselves. There are also many digital production for our study, we can use them for looking for new English words and looking through the webs. So the digital Productions have a great affect on our lives.
As far as I am concerned, we should have a right attitude towards the digital productions. On the other hand, they can make our life colorful and more convenient in the other hand, they also can make someone worried because someone will be addicted in some digital games, and there are also some productions will give out radiation which will damage our body. So we should use it correctly and don't rely it.

With the digital product, we can do something that can't be done in the former age more over, it makes we students learn faster & better, with a computer, we can find more information that we didn't know.
Everything has its two sides, and so does the digital product. In my opinion, when we use the digital product in a proper way, it can help us very much, but if it been used in wrong way, it can also damage ourselves. So, we should use the digital product in a proper way.

If you want to find a place or some people, you can use the GPS stellite positioning receiver. Thus you can easily make it. And our learning is also connected with digital products. For example, we learn English, we can practise listening with MP3. If you don't know how to deal with something, a phone is possible.

So its called Digital Age. Not only means the speed of updating is high, but also it's large omling for us to select.
In some extent, we can no longer separat those digital products from our daily life nowdays. Cellphone, computer, camera , car, and so on and on, you may never find "a piece of clear land" without the shaclavs of electronics in our social life. It's important to take full advantages of those products, for it brings convenient, clear, and simple to our life. A famous saying like this: "The quality of our life lies in the thought that how simple we can be means how wealth we are." I think it's true, when there is a way of simple that can be made by moder technology, why don't we go into the high qualith life?
I'm so lucky, and so are you , that we can meet such a beautiful sight in humans long history. Like breezy wind flowing like, sunshine spring surrounding, the simple life based on the great age is coming.

"Mr Jobs" has passed away! This information may be the most unbelievable one in 2011. Why? Does "Mr Jobs", the former CEO of Apple really have such power?
To be honest, yes.
As we know, the digital products become more and more popular among common people. Nearly each one has one or two digital products. You can't deny that we have run into "The Digital Age".
But how digital products effect our life? For myself, for example, every morning I won't wake up until my cellphone rings, and when I feel boring between two classed. I would listen some pop songs by my mp4. If I want to buy something useful but I don't want to go outside, shopping online is  a good choose. Almost everything I want to do I will find a fittable product to complete it.
However, is this kind fo life really good for us? As far as I concerned, digital products really make the life more convenient and colorful, but there are also many risks hiding in them. I remember that there was a girl become deaf because she listens to the music when she is sleeping. So I think we must use the digital products moedstly.

Nowadays, with the development of science of technology, we are enjoying a digital age. We have to say there are more and more electronic and they have brought great influence on our daily life.
I'd like to say the digital products have made our life more convenient on all sides. Firstly, It's easier for us to communication with others. We can chat with our friends through computer,send message to others make telephone whenever you want and so on. Thus all making people closed. Secondly, It's convenient for us to get information. Tv ,radio, computer and so on .All these can give us lots of useful information. Finally, It makes our life more enjoyable, we can get relaxed very easily.
I like digital products very much. They make my life colorful and I can always enjoy myself. They are my life necessities.

As we know, the digital production makes great influence to one own it. Taking example by me, I often chat with my friends on net, surf to know some thing, watch matches.
In my words, digital production makes our life colorful and more fast, we almost can do every thing through it, of course,sleep and eating not included. But you can't let it spoil your life and study.

Now we don't feel strange about the digital products any more. They are updating rapidly and plays an increasing improtant role in our life.
The reason, I think wehy the digital products form a large amount is that they suit our requires in every aspect, We use digital comera to take pictures of a high quality. And we may buy a mp4 to serve our hobby of movies.It is beyond imagination if we live without the digital products.The computer would jam . The car would never move far. Our life would be in massiness.
So I speak highly of the digital products. They make our life more beautiful than any time before. I have to say that the digital age is one of the most important victories of human beings. And no one can predict where the future will go with the digital business.

Nowadays,more and more electronic products appreas in our life, such as :computer, phone, creame, mp3,mp4,etc. They almost cover all aspects of our life.
They make a most important effect on our lives. We can use computer to work, talk with others on phone,and the other things,like ,mp3, mp4,is just for fun. We can not lead a normal life without these products. For example, more than half people will use computer to finish their work, teachers will use them to help teach, because of the computer, I could buy the ticket for going home. Every week, I will use phone to talk to my father and mother to tell them some more interesting things around me.
I think the electronic products play a important rule in my life, I will support them and maybe I also will be a producer in the future.

Because the technology changes more faster, now, the digital produce become more and more, like cellphone,MP3,MP4,camera and more. All of these which we usually use in our daily life have made a large inffluent to our life. We can use cellphone to call others, communicate with other people even we don't meet together. And we also can use cellphone to surf the Internet, download the movie which we like and get the information we need. We can't use the MP3 for listening the music and use the MP4 to watch the soap opera. And now, the lektop can use more time than before,so we can work,study, play games or do other thing when we are in outdoor. They give us more conveniente.
I think the digital produce are good things for our life,but they also have some bad inffluents. Some people like play games, so that they don't study hard or finish the work. It's a bad thing to do.
If we can use it for our life, it can make our life better, when we use it in a right way. Or it will make us feel more serious than before when our technology was much worse than now.

With time going by and scientice booming, digital products are within reach for ordinary people now. From childen to the old, almost everybody from almost everywhere of the world has some digital productions, such as cellphones, mp3,mp4 and so on.
Undoubtely,digital productions have impacted every aspects of our life. They change our way of thinking, talking even love. The earth has become a contryside, and we will get much information everyday.
In my opinion, digital productions have good and bad use, it's a two side sword. On the one hand, they make us keeping pace with the time, and they make us learning everything much easier, which is the foundamentation of our convenience. However, on the other hand, digital productions are threating our health, which is my first worry.
But no matter what to say, I can't live without digital productions, so I will support their development.

Nowadays. There are more and more digitals in our life. For example, almost everyone has a mobilephone, which is usually I-phone,Nokia,ZTE and so on. Every family has computer in room......So our life change a lot. First of all, the communication is much easier than many years ago. We used to have to write letters. But we can use e-mail today. And the communication also can be going on by Internet like QQ and RenRen. What's more, like using photoshop to do photo. Also,people are taking more and more photos in usual life which is very difficult in oroal life. In my opinion, There is no doubt that the digital makes our life more and more colorful. So we should thank for digital. But thanks to digital, our life sometimes is plainful. We may feel unhappiness sometimes because of digital. We may be worried other people see our every day by using digital and listen every words we speak. So The Digital Age is the most beatiful age and the most colorful age but also, it is the boringest age.

Nowadays, electronics are becoming more and more, and we all use some of them almost everyday. Thus, electronics have influenced people's life in different aspects.
With the development of telephone, the relation between we and our friends is becoming more and more convenient. In ancient times, people will wait for a very long time for the message from relatives via letter, but in modern times, we can call our friends, families and classmates by phone, and we can also communicate with others by short messages via mobilephone.Besides, the education has also developed so well that almost everyone can get a good education, for example, we students can use  an MP5 to download some study sources to learn. It's so convenient. What's more, electronics have also brought us a lot of disadvantages. When they are produced they may cause some pollution to the air and water and when they can hardly be used their batteries may destroy the soil or water.
As fas as I'm concerned,Electronics have brought us both advantages and disadvantages, but not one can be perfect to satisfy everyone. So I think electronics is always good to our life.

There are more and more digital productions of life in the world. These productions have made such a great difference that people depend on them more and more.
For example, computers now play an important role in the life,everyone uses it to communicate and meet with relatives or friends far away, besides, more and more people uses computers to do the works and find datas or calculate the complex problems. Mobile phones are another memeber of digital production.Now almost everyone has one phone and they send short messges or call others. It is convenient for others to connect with you if you are outside.
Faced with a great number of digital procuctions, I know that my life will be colorful with them, but I must open my eyes because not everything is useful for me. I must learn to how to contribute my money to them,and how to use them efficienthy. Only by doing this, I may lead a happy life.

Nowadays,digital production is developing rapidly. More and more digital productions have gone to people's life.for example, the TV we watch programes, the phones we use to talk, etc. These digital productions have great influence on every aspect of people's life, sometimes we even can't live without them. We can't image what it would be if we can't see TV, can't use phones,can't use digital products to contact with others or to entertain ourselef! So, we have to say, it is a Digital Age.
But, is this a good phenomenon? Maybe not. As I see it, they actully takes us a lot of convenience, but  they also waste us a lot of time and even many people get addicated to them. I think we should use them reasonable to help us live better, not let them control us, we should restrick the hours we use them, or we would loss the chance to find the beauty in the real world.

Nowadays, it becomes more and more usual for people to use some digital products. Even many olders are still learning how to use a computer, a DV, an ipad and so on. In a world, if you don't have them or don't know how to use them, we have to say thay you are out of fashion now!
As we can see, these digital products do really have a great effort on many aspects in our daily lives! Maybe it took a long time when we want to communicate with our friends many years ago. However, only with a cellphone or a click of mouse, can you send your photos your voice, your ideas to a friend wherever he is in the world. Aparently, the PC also do us a lot of favour, which it can solve problem we meet in a short and limited time. Moreover, it is convienient if want to get some information, for we can get in touch with the Internet just by a phone or an i-touch.
In my opinion, although, we may waste our time on playing some games with it, the strength of them overweight their shortcomings, I will use them in good ways to make my life easier, and my study better.

For example, it is much more convinient for us to communicate with others with cellphone. And computer is a perfect tool to deal with large amount of data. However, on the other hand, digital product may do harm to us while it is used unlimittedly. For example, using to much celephone may ruin our health.

Now, the digital productions are flooding our life everyday,every minites or every second. And your phone may be not only your phone. You can use it as GPS, Walkman or any other things. It turely made our life more comfortable and convienient. Even we will find ourselves are addicted to these things ,we will not be able to live a "normal" life without them. For example, I may feel lost when I run out of the energy of my cellphone.And I believe almost everyone may be just like me.
So, will it be good to allow the digital member to join our life. I don't think there is a certain answer.It depends on how you manage them or how they manage you. For example will you feel ok when someone say thay you are out of style, for you just don't own the newest phone?

We call it the digital age, so there is no doubt that the digital products are full of our life and have a big influence on our life. First, they make our life more and more colorful. Many players of music like mp3, mp4 are smaller and smaller, so that we can take them everywhere and listen to good music. It makes us enjoy our life. Second, they give us a more convenint life. When we use computer, we can book any tickets though it. So there is no need for us to wait long time for a ticket.
With their influence on our life, I must say some my ideas on them. One coin has two sides, these digital products have advantage and disadvantage. I have to admit that they make our life easier. Every one in modern life can't abandon them. But they also give us some worries. First it takes our many new illness. Second, they offer some new pattern of crime easily. 
As we know, we should be wise in the digital age, make the digital product work for us better.

With the development of modern information and electronic products industry, there are more and more digital products which make humans life easier and more convinient, in the meanwhile, it also causes side effects. The following are some opinions about this issue.
Obviously, some people would think that digital products play an important role in our daily life, especially computers and cellphones. By using these tools of communication, we can get latest information in time and keep in touch with our friends and parents, what's more, digital products widen our horizon and improve our ability to communicate with others. On top of that, computer now has already become one of the necessities in our daily life, we can use it to work for companies, to manage our money, to enjoy love and so on. In a word, digital products have made huge influences in vaneties of aspects of our life.
However, others will have a totally opposite opinion about that. They think digital products make human beings lazier and unhappy because of it's convenience. Besides, digital products will be bad for our health, for example, cellphone will hurt our eyes especially when we read ebooks at night. And walkman will affect our sense of hearing nagatively. In all, digital products will replace the movement of our faculthes and make us become some useless fatters.
In my opinion, digital products is good for our life, at the same time, it will has a negative effect on our life. The key point is how you balance them, if you solve this problem, digital products will become one of the necessities in your daily life.

There is no doubt that we can't go our life normal without digital production. Now day, the amount of digital production were increasing and that have influence us in every hand. We use telephone, scientist make big caculations by computer, travelers use GPS to visit everywhere. As we can see, digital production plays an important roll in our life.
Every corn has two side, effactly, not every digital production used in good was. As we all known, in China, a lot of student are addicted to computer games, also a big amount of people surf in the internet all days. They make their eyes bad, and make body unhealthy. Obsolutly they possible fail in study and works.
In my opinion, we should use the digital production under control. If some one can't work or study without computer, he/(she) can use it in a limit time. And after work or study, he/she should leave it to do some sports. In this way, we can get better outputs.

Nowadays, digital products become more and more. Such as the mobile phone, MP3, CD player, calcular, computer and so on. Lots of normal things are become digital too, like electronic watch and digital photograph. We can say that digital products are everywhere and nowhere.
Actually, the electronic products did here a great influence to our life, or even changed our lifestyles. In the past, if we want to know something new, we much read lots of books, but now, we just click the mouse. Not very far, 20 years ago, multiplications and divisions are so difficult to students when they study mathmatics or science, but now, calculators can help us do these boring jobs and they do these much faster and accurately.
In my opinion, the flooding of the digital products has a good aspect and a bad aspect. They accually helped us to solve lots of problems and make our life much more confortable. But something like computer games really have a very bad influence to many teenagers. So, we must become the masters of electronic products and let them dominate us.

For example computer is very useful to us and many ways it can hooked us it.

As the developing of technology, the electrical production have more influence human life. The most typical ones is computer. The computer do can every thing, but the effect not only is perfect, but also have bad.
Every one know one thing have two size, the electrical production is so, we can sure it can help me a lot, but it can have bad effect such as resources problem, air pollution problem and so on.
I think we should develop the care which product electrical production or have relation with electrics, because in my opinion, it can have good influence more than bad influence, but we also think about the resourses problem or pollution problem before developed it.

In mondon world, it seems one can't live without digital product. In nineteen sixtys, people have a digital booming. Cell phones, digital watches, MP3, MP4 and of course computers have been used anywhere.
It make a big change that the digital booming. For example, you could only go to library to search for some information, but it's much more easy to tap some word and search them on the Internet. And it was hard to imagine 40 years ago that you can call some one at anytime anywhere.
I think digital age make people more exhusted. Because one will be send more work even if he is home. And you can find someone easily. Of course digital product is useful. You can listen to the music everywhere. In some way, I like the digital age.

As we can see, more words have a special addition "e", just like "e-mail", "e-book" because of the discovery - electric and invatation - machine. Many mall have some stores to sale cellphone, MP4, computer, PSP and others. For some people, those are not machines but just like a part of there body.
With electric things get more and more popular, a lot of change is happening in our life. Longer time to work, greater production, more ways to play gemes and glasses sales have more money. It's strange, unbelieveable but funny.
I don't think it is bad but not bilieve it must be good. Every thing need a balance point. Electric things help us do some difficult things and boring jobs, but they make some laser that we can not fine break our body. They solve old problem but take new damage. We should reserch some new machine can help us and can't injured their owner or find some new ways to protect ourselves.
In the end, I want to give you a piece of advice: Body is the most expensive luxury for us. Have a good shape is eaqul to have anything.

Nowadays, there are more and more digital productions fiooding into our daily life, such as the MP3, MP4 and the cell-phone. Living in the life filled with the digital production, we may call the time the digital age.
It is no doubt that the digital productions have played an important role in many fields in our life. For example, the using of cell-phone make it possible and comfortable that we want to talk with some friend faraway. And the MP3 can certainly play the songs to relax ourselves after a nervous working. However, each coin has two sides. The over-using of the digital productions takes up much time in our life. We may play computer for a long time without exercise. Some students may listen the music in the class so that they accept little knowledge after class ends.
In my opinion, everything has its own advantages and disadvantages. How their work in our life, in fact, depends on ourselves. In the digital age, we should learn to resist the tempts and make the active use of the digital productions for our life. Is that so?

Nowadays, with the development of science and technology, the digital age is more and more popular. As we see, the digital age has made a great influence on each aspect of our daily life.
Hundred years before, talking with a person miles away is unbelieveable but now we can even communicate with friends abroad using the telephone. Several years ago, people must to go to the shopping mall or a market to by something, but now we can buy almost everything at home just clicking the mouse. How wonderful! I think computer is a very important includes of the digital ago. I make our life more convenient, more colourful and more popular. With the digital camera, we can take photos in beautiful places and ps it to make the photo more satisfied in computer. The digital age makes our daily life better some way but it also has several harmful influence. The telephone is not safe and healthy for children to use. The computer games make many students addicted in it and failed their exams. The digital age also has a bad impact to the environment.
I think that each coin has two sides so does the digital age. We will not give up using it for its disadvantages but we must try to use it more smart and more careful. I believe that the digital age can be a good thing for human beings if we use it properly.

It make our lifes becoming more and more convenient, for example, if you have a phone, and you just want to talk to someone who is not near to you then you can just make a phone call, you can talk to him, or you need to visit and talk face to face. So we can say eletronic product has made a great effect to oue life, without this product we can not have a easy life even a fruit company - Apple company make its advertisement "change the world again". It shows that this product make a great effect in our life, but in my opinion though electronic product make a great effect to our life, it also make some bad influence for example, it will effect the students make their study bad, so we should control ourselves, let this eletronic product do advantage to use.

Our students maybe use the MP3 to listen to the musica. We also use the computer to solve some problems and get information to promote study. Every electricates have the function to affect our lifes.
We enjoyed the electricates because they make our life better. But we should recoginase some electricates do harm to our healthy. So we should use the electricates carefully and in right way. I hope a brighter future of the digital electricates.

The digital products play an important role in modern society. It can't imagine the life without those digital tools will be. Communications must be rougher and more expensive without cellphone. Long travel transportation becomes difficult and danger if planes and ships are all lack of the GPS satellite positioning tools. The public education also has to face up a disaster because books will be harder to get when the digital printers and computers don't work any more. Each of us should try to make fun without TVs, MP3s, computers and so on, it's must be boring.
Clearly the digital products enable our life more convenient and comfortable, but the abusing of them can do harm to us as well. Some digital are made of those things like Pb and Hg, it can cause a serious pollution. The microwaves from digital tools like cellphones and computers can hurt our brains and hearts. In my view, if we can work well without the digital tools, it's better to do it on our own.

In my opinion, it is very interesting but young man should use it by plans. We couldn't play it when we are learning or working. And it will damage our body if we use too much time to play it. And we should use it to learn knowledge. If we can use it by science plan, we can get more fun from it.

The products created by Jobs, like mac-book, iphone and so on, has changed our way of life, it makes us have a new understanding of the world, what's more, it makes us crazy for it. Not only "Apple", there are more and more unbelieveable product we could use, we enjoy them, and gradully, we can't live without them.
Computer help us to write, to scan news and even to watch TV, mobile phone make us could communication with anybody in any time... In a word, we could do everything with them, or say that we can't do anything now without them.
In my opinion, those products give us a happier life and bring to us many surprise and happiness. We should keep creating more things like them to make a better world.

Nowadays, many kinds of digital devices exists in our daily life. The most important digital devices make a greatful influence in people's life even changed the people's life style.
The computer, once of the most important invention in 20th century definitelly changed the people's life style. People can get information immediately by go to the news website. People know what happens in every  where in the world now. People contact each other by go to social website like facebook. They share their happiness, sadness in their own page and they can know what's their friends thingking and doing now.
In school, digital devices is everywhere too. People use cellphone to contact each other or search many information about their study work by internet. And the school information open system also build up on the modern digital technology. In each classroom, modern devices give the teachers chance to use the video to show their grateful ideas easier and students can easy to understand. Students have a much better class experience than before. Also the recorder and micphone in the English teaching classroom can give me a chance to practice spoken English by myself. So we can know that every digital devices play a important part of the life.
I think during the digital devices make our life wonderful. It also cause a serious of problems. When the digital devices is open, they make eletric-mangetic radiation may cause some healthy problems. And the devices which is used and broken may become the digital rabiage and cause serious environment problems. But nowadays is real the digital age. Wherever, people can deal with these problems and make world better and better.

Since the invention of computer and its technique, people all around of the world are coming into digital age. Especially since 10 years ago, with technique promoting, digital devices are blooming. We can easily find a school student playing ipad games. An officer working with office 2000 and even an 100-year-old man using phone to shop online...
In fact, electrinic devices does a lot of influence on our life. It change our life greatly. For example, we play games on computer while our parents during our childhood play with a iron wheel. Message passing also changes a lot: formal people use horses, pigeons and so on and they always use 10 days to pass the message but today there is a cellphone that we can talk from China to America only in just a few seconds. In industry, school, gorvernment, the digital devices also have it effect.
I speak highly of it. I think it process human's life greatly and make everything convenent. Not only that,  nowadays, we has come into a time connot leave the digitals alone. We become dependence, so we must do something to make digital devices more presprous.

Long long before, the light are created. It must be the first electricity product. It make us could study in the night. It bring us light in the darkness.
Now, not only light was created, human beings has created others products like phone, mobile phone, computer, or mp4. especially computer. It change the work path. Before the computer's created, the paper was used a lot so that the tree would cut a lot. Not only the paper, the rate are rise by the computer.
After computer being created, human being has created notebook computer. It make the computer more quickly.
Electricity products is not only for work, but also for study for life. It bring us a lot of benefit, but it bring us some dangrous things in the same time. Many people, especially children were died by electricity.
In my opinion, I think the electricity was a great created we should use it safety to make the life more happeness.

The advantages of digital production is that they make our life more interesting and convinion. Without digital production, we can only write a letter to a person who live very far from us, but now we can call him or surf the internet to chat with him. We can use computer to play game or find some information, it really makes our life vivid.
On the other hand, the disadvantages of digital production is that more and more student prefer playing computer games to studying. I think this is a bad thing for themself.
So, we should correctly use the digital production and make it more useful for us.

They always spent the whole day on it because they needn't do anything outside. They study on the Internet, play games on the Internet, go shopping on the Internet, and chat with others on the Internet. Just be on the Internet!

But now, if you want to get in touch with someone, You can communicate with him or her easily by phone. And you can know everything occurring at any corner of the earth immidiately at home by TV but needn't go out. This is unbelievable several hundred years age.

I thing the digital age is so good. We can do more work and use less time. We can know the lastest news at the first time. We can talk with our friends, families or the person you don't know when you are in Beijing but he is in England. You would buy what you want on the Internet and you would listen to music every where. It's so great!

With the development of society, the electronic products are going to every people's hands even several years ago. A television can be a luxury but now, it is just a necessity. Just look the college students every people has a cellphone, and you can also see some people handle a camera taking a picture. Most people have already owned their own computers.
We have to accept the fact that the electronic product have brought a great influence on every side of our life for example. We communicated with letters several years ago, but now, it is out of date. Cellphone is more convenient in delivering the message. So we can make some decisions on time, and we can know the news from all over the world. Computer is also an important tool for us to learn about the world. We can learn some knowledge with the help of computer and we can play computer games to relax ourselves, also. We can make friends on-line.
In my view, the electronic product is a good helper for us to explore the world. We can make use of it to change our world. So our life  will become more colorful and our world will become harmoney.

With the development of society and techonology, electronic products have came into the public's life. Those days, those products are renewed continually, and we have enter the digital age.
Those products have apparantly great impact to each aspect of our life. We can see, without those electric products, our life or study wouldn't be colorful. For example, MP3 or MP4 are of great use that they can make our life, and spirits beautiful when we listen music or watch movie after bustling work or study. Besides, these also can be of help to our English level improvement. Of course, if we are intereting in singing song, they are fantastic tools, too. Apart from those, mobiephones are a part of our life for they make our life convient when we contact with others easily. And any more, such as camera, electric watch and so on, those are helpful, too.
As electric products can make a big influents to our life, it has aroused a huge concern in our society. On my opinion, we can't deny that these electric products have so many functions to our life. However, we can't neglect their shortcomes. After all, each coins has two sides. For instants, it can make us leasy, beacause we will may rely on them so much. So that it is so dangerous to us.
So, I think we should use it appropriately and make it be useful to us while avoiding their unadevantages.

Nowadays, with the developing of science and technology, more and more electrical products were made up. There's no doubt that these electrical products have made great differences in our lives. It seems that no one could live anymore if all these electrical products suddenly disappear.
It is worldly believed that most of the electrical products make possitive sense in our daily lives. Planes make us travel faster and save time to us, mobile phones make our communication convenient and easily, and TV makes our lives colorful. These are all great inventions. With these electrical products, our world become little, we can easily go anywhere on the earth within days, we can keep in touch with our parents and friends wherever we go, and we can find many things for entertainment when we feel boring.
Though there are also something bad, but in totally, electrical products are good for our human.

Today, science and technology have been more and more important. Science and technology let us have a lot of electrical products like computer, TV and radio. Almost there are not person who doesn't have mobilephone. I believe we will have more and more electrical products in the future.
By using this products, our life have a large change. Before we have computer, we must have some news by reading newspaper. Sometimes, we can't spend little time to know what happened in the whole world. But now, we have Internet. We can know the world quickly by Internet. When students study in the school, teachers can have a class by using computer's screen. So they can't have to write words on the blackboard. It's great, so that we can save much time. Now, more and more electrical products have large influences in our life.
In my eyes, electrical products are important. We can't live without them. But, they may cause some environmental problems I think we should have a balance of them and try our best to make our life comfortable.

With the economic and scient development, now, the electric product is more and more. And they have comed to our daily life gradually.
The electric product have an important part on many sides of our life, and our daily life couldn't be apart from them. For example, in study, most of us are using computer to look through the knowledge. In message, the TV, the radio, and the computer become the main tools. And Mp3, Mp4 are used by us to listen music and see movie.
But as one coin has two sides, the electric product bring our convience, at the same time, they also bring many troubles to us. For example, many of us took less activity because of them so that our physcial health is worse than before. And it also bring the electric polluction with wheir occur.

As the devoleping of technology, the digital production grows rapidly, both in quality and quantity. Nowday, almost everyone has more than one digital instrument, we do have walked into the digital age, no matter what you think about it.
Electric technolegy and their goods have change our normal life a lot. The biggest effection, amony all, I think, maybe the mobilphone. Some people, particularly the students born after 90's, couldn't go out with no phone in our pockets. Every spare time we have,the first thing we will think must be play the microphone. So, every month we wast on this technology is a large amout, both of money and time. The other electric product also changed our daily life deeply, like computer or the television, a big proportation of people enjoy their life lying on the safe, watching TV or play computer games, the science of this aspect have comfort our life so much, and influence our so much.
I think most effect the electric technology bring to us was positive, but if a person who can't control himself well, he may fell into the hole of it, like playing computer games all day time, or do some forbidden things by Internet. So, if we use this technology proporty, the poweful capcity of it we will feel.

Since the revolution of technology, various digital tools come into people's life. They make our life covinient and improve the quality of life. Digital tools can be seen everywhere and people seem to hardly live without them. Of course, they are necessary and important.
If someone want to talk with others, he must come to the place where they can face to face with each other in the past time. Nowadays, this thing get much more easier by the phone or computer. Also, digital tools help us in cooking. Microwave could heat food in very short time. As for people's work, there are full of digital tools too. Most of people work with their computer. For environment, some electrical tools for children are pretty good. In a word, the influence of digital tools a giant.
In my opinion, digital tools chage our life and make it more efficial. I am farturnate to live in the digital age, though there are also some questions.

As there is a growing number of electrical products, more and more people are willing to call our age is The Digital Age. there is no doubt that these product has deeply influenced our lives from food to transport almost every aspects.
However, for where I stand, the electrical products are only one kind of commen product amony the variety of human's creations. In some aspects, take internet for example, we even can't excutely say it is benefits us more or impact us in the bad aspact deeper. Since we can see children who are lost in the computer games here and there, how can we still say The Digital Age is good for our future.
Knowledge to us is what water to fish. So it's important for us to keep the science and technology forward forever. But can still not too optimism, because all things are two sides, or that is we should use the electrical product carefully and directly.

Nowadays, we all can see that there are more and more digital products. For the public, the cellphone becomes a necessrity whose funcations are not just for calling others. Other things such as MP5, i-Pad,  digital camera of higher and higher technology also rush to us.
At the same time, the influence that the digital products take to us is huge even changing our lives and the whole world. It's easy to see that people can communicate with others much more convenient than before with sending message though QQ and Fetion anywhere and whenever. And many people are likely to put on their feeling or what they are interested in via microblog and RenRen. Fresh things can spread fast just because of these digital products.
In my opinion, I consider those digital products as a success of the development of the scence and technology. And I also enjoy them for I can see a colorful life changed by the digital products in the digital age.

Now we can write by computer, draw by computer, communicate with each other by telephone, take a picture by telephone and surfer Internet by telephone everywhere and everytime. The digital things also can help us work, they can make us work quicker and easier, so now, the digital things is very important in our life, if we leave them, we will fill very uncomfortable.

I think we should invent more digital things and make them better, can do more things and then people will have more time to do some things are more important.

Someone says that we're in the digital age. As they say, there are more and more electrical products today. The intellectual mobile phones the pads, the PSPs, the digital cameras are all the things without what we can't live. So I think that we should make good use of the electrical products and lead a new thought in our mind towards the electrical products.
Nowadays, the electrical products have made important influences to every aspects of us human life. For example, in the UK, a set of technical fixes is already making life harder for car thieves. This electrical products won't allow the thieves to restart cars once it stops. So it become good for human's life.
I believe that if we make full use of the electrical products, we will lead a better life in the digital age.

The digital things such as digital camera, make the people's life more colourful.
I also think the digital product is very useful to us through sometimes it can lead to some problems. For example, the student use them and become crazy about the computer game, some people use electronical thing too much and it has a bad effect on their health. But it still help us to have better life. The digital camera can take a picture and it is quite easy to use it. The digital mobile phone has a lot of function and let us to contact other conviniently. We also use some computer with our communicate and search for something. Over all, the electronical product changed our life in many terms. We can let our life better only if we use it in a right way.

With the development of science and techology, more and more high-techology products had been inviented. They make our life more and more convient, but they also can destroy our life.
Many high-techology products make our life more colourful. Such as TV, cell-phone, computer and so on. But even if the greatest inviention--computer, if we use it without self-control, we will lose ourselves. Some people surf the internet for a very long time to play the computer game or don't know what should do but don't want to leave the computer. That is bad for our life. We must know what is the real world.
In my opinion, high-techology products make our life well, but we must use them with self-control. Only in this way, can we make our life better.

Now we can do anything at home with the help of cellphone and computer. But on the other hand, our life begin to baise on them. Some people may feel that they can't live without computer.

A lot of aspects of people's life has been changed by digital products. Computers and Internet connect everybody. So people can do a lot of things without going out. In the one hand, it makes life more comfortable and more convenient. But on the other hand, some students like to talk in the Internet so much that they lose themselves in the Internet and their ability to communicate with others become weaker and weaker. And the popularity of digital products make the information spread faster. The earth is now like a village because the connections are so strong and people can know in time what are happening in other places.
I think that the digital products make our life more beautiful and convenient. They change our life greatly. We should get used to this. But we should also have correct understanding of them, and use them correctly.

The digital product influence our life from many aspects, in terms of relaxing ourselves, we can listenning to music by an ipod, watching programs on TV, searching informations, doing some shopping via Internet. When you are taking public transportation, you can see almost everyone hold a mobile phone in his or her hands. The digital product also come into our study. We always use the electronic dictionary, many students tackle complex statistics through computer. The digital product riches our life, help us study better. But it has some bad influences. Using a ipod can cut us off from outside, lead to less communication. Digital product also waste lots of time.
In my opinion, I think we should take advantages of the electronic product. We should use them to help us study, relax and so on. But, everything has a limit, do not waste much time on them, try to avoid them doing harm to you life.

I think these things are good in all, though they also have some bad aspects. For example, some students are lost in computer games. The traffic is in tension. Or some people lost lives in traffic. But their good aspects are more than bad aspects. We should know this.

We call this age we live in the information and digital age. For example, computer and internet offard us a new way for communication. We can talk about almost every thing together and play games with other people. We may never see each other. And like washer, drier those electricity can help us with the hoursework. while they are working, we can sit on sofa having a cup of caffee. That's so nice.
But if we depond on machine for everything. That may destroy the civilazition. Think about that after hundreds years, we could do nothing but lie on the bed and the rabbert do everything good for us. I don't think that's happy life.
So my oppion for the digital things is that we can use those but not for every thing. They are just tools for us to have a better life.

On the one hand, it brings us convenient. Such as the computer, with it we can work more efficient and do less work, so that we will have more time enjoy ourselves. At the same time, we can also learn more about the world at the latest time. And the digit camera give us more clear photos so that we can leave the happy memories in our life at anytime.
But on the other hand, it also has some disadvantages. With so many electricities in our life. The children pay less attention on what they learn in class. Instead, they are often absorbed in the coloful players and even addicted to them. That's what we want to look.

Just like a coin has two aspects, facing the electric products, different people also have different ideas. In my opinion, as a symble of the highly developed technology, we should accept such products with an optimistic attitude. Because there is no doubt that they are really convinent our life to a very real extent. We can know what happened miles away by the televation, and we can also listen to music for relax.

Just take a look around. Instead of knocking hard on the front door, we now make a easy click on the bell with one finger. Instead of writing hundreds of words and waiting depressed for weeks, we now use mobilephone to contact with each other. Instead of standing in line nervously to get a film ticket, we now stay in bed and watch the film on TV with some tasty cookies. We cook with electric, we work with electric, we do almost everything with it. In a word, it's much more convenient for us to have digital products around us. Almost everyone gives his best comment on it. However, does it really benifit us so well?
I don't think so. As we all know that, the available electronic energy is running out, and we haven't found the alternative. What will happen if the electronic line is cut off? We shouldn't relax ourselves so much. Being a bit more independent, not only for now, but for the future.

With the development of technology, more and more electronic products appear in our life. Including the traditional devices such as cellphones, MP3, digital cameras, computers, and the lastest products like iPad, iPod player and so on. The variety of these products is growing larger and larger.
Nowadays, these digital products have a huge influence on every aspect of our life. As it's more convenient to communicate by sending short messages or e-mails, fewer and fewer people would like to write a letter. For the computer and the Internet have a much higher speed. We no longer depend on the newspaper or the news-report to get the latest news. What's more, we have more devices to enjoy ourselves such as the iPad and PSP. In a word, these digital products have enriched our daily life.
In my opinion, the booming of these devices shows the development of the modern society, but it may also do harm to the society. Since it is convenient to chat online and almost everything can be done on the computer, more and more people just stay at home and face to the screen all-day-long. They refuse to go outside and get access to the nature, so more and more health problems affect their life.
To sum up, we should use the digital devices properly. On the one hand, we can enjoy the convenience they bring us. On the other, we shouldn't let them affect our healthy life style.

Our lives have changed a lot since last few years and it is expected to change even more in the next few years with those product, for example, mobile phone has made our communication easy and convenient. With a phone we can talk with anyone we want to, and digital camera make us record the important situations and things. What's more, computer has become a important part in our dairly lives, it can be used in many aspects in our lives, such as education, science and medical produce. TV, as every family may have, has made us imformed of the current affairs and lates news.
However, digital product also has nagative effects on our lives. As they are used much more often, they can be harmful to our body, if children used computer too much, he may be addicted to it. So I think we should use it properly and make use of its positive use.

Today, there are many digital productions borning in the world. Such as the cellphone, the computer, the TV set and so on. They make our life abundant, and they affect us a lot.
Because of the science and teconology, the digital things become more and more incredible. For example, the remote immobiliser in the car, it combines with the GPS and prevents our cars from stealing. It is convient to us. After the class, we always take our heavy body home, this time, if we watch a movie or play some relaxed game, we may feel better. Indeed, sometimes they do good for us.
However, I think we should not optimistic all the time. If we abuse the digital things, we may be injured. Children like the new things, some often watch TV or watch computer screen so that their eyesight get worse and worse. Some college students are absorbed in the computer game so that they miss their education. Some throw the digital things anywhere so that the evironment is damaged day by day.
Therefore, we should use the digital things efficiently and use it in the right way. Don't throw them away, don't abuse them, don't play computer games all the time, don't pollute the environment. The digital things make our life better, and we should also make our environment better.

Nowadays, with the high level of technology is been developed, there are more and more modern electric products go in our life, such as phone, computer, mp3 and so no. I think almost everyone is living with these new things.
In fact, these new things make people's life change a lot. For example, before the lots of cellphones been used, people communicate with others who far away from ourselves by writting envelop and It is hard for us to find our friends, but now, we can communicate with each other despite the distance between us by a phone call. Before the computer and the television been used, people's way to get news only include video, newspaper, and now we can get news by computer and television, this is far faster than before.
But In my eyes, these new things have some bad effects, too. Phone make us more easy to communicate, but meanwhile, it reduce our ability to communicate with others face to face. Computers take many available news to us, however, it take many bad things to us at the same time, one of which is the computer games, now more and more students are addicted to these games and give up their study.
Everything has two faces, one is good things and another is bad thing, the modern electric products are like this, too. We can't make sure it is good or bad for our life, it is according to ourselves.
