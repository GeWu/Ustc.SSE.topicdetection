Many individuals believe that digital products is benefical not only because it can bring joy when we feel boring,relax ourselves under such big social pressure,and also take off the sadness with many funny ways.Like watching TV shows,chatting on line and paly computer games either.But also because it could bring us very diffrient lifes,it can let we knew what happens around us,to catch every moving moment within life like what camera did.
On the contray,quite a few people consider digital products has its negtive effects.For one thing,it may cost much money to buy them and also to fix them,which will result in the money not balance,like so many people interested in buying new style of cellphone called IPHONE,even they sold bloods or something else,that sounds terrible.For anoher thing,digital products is not very safe,for examples,computer may leaking our person secrets which would lead in awful things happen.

Living in the digital age,we are unavoidably exposed to all kinds of digital products,such as digital camera ,digital computer,digital television,and so on,which grow in an increasing categories and quantities.Believe it or not,look around youeself ad you can easiy find one or two of these stuffs.
Here is a question,what kind of influence do the digital products bring to people life?Frankly speaking,these modern digital productsoffer us a more convenient life than before.For example,the digital camer makes it6 possibvle to delete or correct the "unsuccesswful"photo of ours,which was impossible with the traditional camera.While,unfortunately,these fashionable digital items have cultiovated a generation more isolated from the real life.It is hard to image that a man so accustomed to the digital mobile on-line chatting can be capable of the practical communication with others.Finally,too much dependent on the digital things,human seem to be real world,which we,thouh reluctant to admit,have to accept.
Thus,as the generation assailed by all kinds of digital miracles,we might as well initiatively avoid some of them despite efficiency and comfort they can supply.Do not forget those old days when you were going to visit an old school friend though there would be a long train journry,which,in today's digital era,has been thoroughly replaced by the digital on-line chatting.

Some people thought that it is good for our life,however,as all coins have two sides,others thought that it is bad for our life.
Those who are thought digital product can bring some good thing to our life is due to: First,we can communicate with our family,friend,classmate.Just like mobliephone.Secoend,we can get some important news from the digital product,just like TV,computer,ang so on.Last but not the least,we can relax ourselves.
Those who are thought digital prudect can bringsomething bad to our life is due to just one reason,that is we may waste a lot of time play games and view something unheathly.
As far as I am concerned,the digital product is just like a rapier.What is most important is that we should make chose by ourselfes,just like the famous saying:"To be or not to be,that is decided by youselves."

Electronic Times is coming，In our Electronic Age，electronic play an important role 
in our life，for example ，computers is very imporant for everyone。As a  student，if  I live without computer，I believe my life will become very boring。nowerdays，people use electronic products to  communicate with each other ，such as ipone ，computer ，and so on。but in the other sides，In the E-era，we can not receive those paper greeting cards any longer which filled with ink ，we can not see the sender’s warm greeting，we  can not get more warm from paper writing ，and our diary book，which recorded our growth process and will comfort ourselves when we getting old，are replaced by the ”blog“ and ”space“。
In my opinion，Electronic Times is very useful for everyone 。we can use it by ourselves and it can get huge informations for everyone，we should use it in right ways。also it has bad influence in our life，it blows away emotions between people，it result to people become unknow in normal life，people always use computers to communicate with each other。so electronic times have good and bad effects。

So ,to my mind, electronic products is  indeed a breakthrough in modern life,but people should not depend on it too much.

The digital age with more and more digital products coming into use,we are entering the digital age.We have computers to process documents at office,we watch digital TV programs at home,and we listen to MP3 players when we are traveling on buses or trains.
It seem that whatever we do we use one digital product or another.Digital products have fundamentally transformde our way of  work,education and life.To start with,the last decades have witnessed immense changes in the workplace owing to the advent of computers.The jobs of book-keepers,typists,copymachine operators have been vaporized by digital comuters and at the same time,computer-related jobs have grown in dramatically large numbers. 
What's more,new digital technologies have made possible"a lenrning revolution"in deucation.It is no surprise to see students sit in multi-media classrooms watching lectures without a lecturer standing on the platform. One of the most fundamental changes that have taken place in how our  leisure time is spent.We listen to the redio and MP3 music on our way,watch TV in the evening and chat with friends about those TV peograms the next day through MSN,an online chatting software.
When we travel,we take a digital camera with us.It is hard to imagine a life without digital products now.

The electricity is widely used in all phases of society. And it becomes more and more  important.In industry,business,education,medicine,nearly all works of life,electricity has made its appearance,providing great speed and accuracy for our work.
The electricity is indispensable to modern civilization.Without electricity,our life and our socity will undoubtedly suffer a big regression.The electricity has been used in the home,offices,laboratories and research institutions,functioning as the most efficient and versatile instruments for calculating,sorting,filling,recording and distributing.
In my opinion,efforts are being made not only to bring the harware to perfection,but also to improve the quality of the software.Electronic products must be instructed and programmed by people.Their achievements are not comparable to what the minds of men are able to do.

As the saying goes ,every coin has two sides. So I am in favor of  the latter view.we may  regarded as inconsiderate if we rushed our decision without any reason.The reasons are as followed:First of all,electronic prooduct  is very useful to our work and study.what is more,it  bring us relaxed feeling,we can use it to play game .  Nevernessless, we may use it too much in playing game,especially for student.
Form what has been discussed above, we may draw the conclusion that electronic product has both advantages  and disadvantages.we  should use it in a right way.

However everything has two sides.In my opinion, we shoud take advantages of it.Sometimes we can use it to study .In fact,electronics are good for study if you use it on study.For esample,we can listen to English music to increase our listening.Also,we can find useful books through competer.But if we use it to play competer games,we may waste a lot of  times.In a word,we should use it usefully.
