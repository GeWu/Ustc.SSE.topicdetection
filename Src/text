In recent years, more and more university students and graduates are inspired to aid the education in some poor places,which became a new phenomenon.
   Aid education is very good for both students and the society.Many students, expecially who are from big cities,had a happy life from their childhood.It is so bad for them to understand the life of a poor ,but doing aid education give him the chance .what's more,it can help them to learn how to slove the different problems in a hard life .when they finish their task and go back to schoolor home ,they will value the good life and good chance to study .on the other hand,the poor area can benefit a lot.Many people in those poor area do not have enough konwledge,so they can hardly live a better life.students who can to do the aid education can help them.so children in those area can learn more knowledge and adults can get more skill,they can create more wealth for themselves  and for the society.In this way,the gap between the poor and the rich becomes narrow,and our society becomes more and more harmonious.
   In my opinion,doing aid education is very meaningful,University students should have a try on it.But studying is still the most important.If you feel it's difficult to balance these two things, try do study well first.
