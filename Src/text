Today in China, many families have only one child. So the children usually doted upon by all family ã€‚members. Gradually some of them get used to depending on their parents and lack the ability to solve problems independently. There are some ways to help children to be independent. Firstly, the child should have a chance to see the world around him. He must understand that therere various competitions in this world, and everyone can find his right position in the society only by individual efforts. Secondly, the parents should give the child enough help to make him feel comfortable. Its impossible to ask a child not to depend on parents at once. A child needs help from the beginningWithout any help, the child may lose his faith. Thirdly, parents should let his child make decisionswhich can temper his ability to deal with problems. A child should be praised when he is successful or when he fails. To be independent is good for the children, because no parents can accompany the children for the whole life. It is the child himself who is responsible for her own fate. Only an independent person can live and succeed in this world.
