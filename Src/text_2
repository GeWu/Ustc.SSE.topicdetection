These years,many college students are encouraged by the goverment to teach in poor area,where teachers are lacked of.For our school ,students are often sended to Haiyuan,Ningxiaprovince.This activity is called Aid Education.
    The Aid Education is a good thing for the students of poor area without doubt.For poverty,those students often can't get enough education.Also,the activity is good for the poor area.The knowledge is the most valuable wealth at all.That activity is also a good matler for the society.It reduces the pressure of the job market.
    In my opinion ,aid education is also helpful for the helpers.That experience may help them know more and deeper about China and think more about the life.The Xu Benyu is just such a sample.I think it's rather good for college students to make a right attitude to life and society.
