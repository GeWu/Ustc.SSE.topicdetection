 Every year a lot of college students are inspired to aid education in the poor area of China,staying there for one or three years .They devotethemselves to the improvement of the education of the poor area.How glorious they are!
   our country is still a developing country which means there is a large amount of people that can't be educated becomes of poor economic and poor resources in some part of China .Improving the people' seducation level is the key of making our country strong and rich ,Thus we should try hard to let every one get educated ,especially in the poor area.Because of those college students ,a lot can be changed in the poor area,They bring the poor kids knowledge that  means they give them the most valuable things .Aidding education is helpful to cover the gap of education level between the poor area and the rich area.
   As far as I am concerned,it's honorable to do such a thing ,and I will think I am useful. Only more and more college students step in this great thing,can our country get stronger and stronger.
