Now, It is common to employ a private tutor for students. It has both good and bad effect[fm1, effects] on your child.
At first, Maybe It's good for your child to study harder, and it can promote your child's score[wd1, study]. But for another thing, It's[sw it's] not good for students to study himself[np1, themselves]. It can make student depond[fm1, depend] on other peoples. So the private tutoring has both good effects and bad effects on students. 
In my opinion, I think the private tutoring is not good. I think we should leave more time for students. We should make students study depending on himself[sn6, by themselves], [sw .] Because when students go to the society, they can only depond[fm1, depend] on himself[np1, themselves]. their [fm1, Their] parents can't help him[np1, them] then. So we should give the students more chances to practice himself[np1, themselves]. It can make them live well when their parents can't help them.
