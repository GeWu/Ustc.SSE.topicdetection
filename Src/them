 In recent years,we witnessed a good phenomenon that many students from different colleges go to some poor countries to teach those poor children every year.
   As we all know, China is a developing country. There are still many difficults in education.For example ,there are not enough teachers and enough good teachers to teach students.And it is more terrible in the poor countrive.In a way, we can see the importance of the Aid Education.To China,those students can do some contributions to the edution.To the poor children ,they can learn more knowledge .so they will have the chance to make a living and make their own dream come true.On the other hand,these students from different colleges can have a chance to live a different life. Living a poor life may not a bad thing .They can become more positive and learn how to protect the happy life.
   In my opinion,Aid Education is a good phenomenon.But not every student can go to teach those poor students.They sould know the responsibility to go to those countries.They must know why they choose the Aid Education .They should teach and care about those children by their hearts.On the other hand ,I think the goverment should improve the life and the education in the poor countries.In this way,I think every children in China can have a chance to go to school.
